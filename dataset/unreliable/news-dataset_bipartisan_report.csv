He‚Äôs repeatedly touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a supposedly useful treatment against the Coronavirus, but there has never been any kind of systematic evidence of the drug‚Äôs actual effectiveness. Now, there‚Äôs a new study available outlining how among tens of thousands of Coronavirus patients, the drug was actually linked to a documented higher risk of death. This week, Hillary Clinton called out Trump for recklessly endangering lives with his glib promotion of the drug.

Antimalarial drug touted by Pres Trump is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to one study. An analysis of 96K patients shows those treated with hydroxychloroquine were also more likely to suffer irregular heart rhythms. https://t.co/XfW8r7KIe6 ‚Äî Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) May 22, 2020

She posted on Twitter:

‚ÄòA study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found that those who received a drug Trump has promoted as a treatment had a ‚Äúsignificantly higher risk of death compared with those who did not.‚Äù The president needs to stop playing a doctor on TV.‚Äô

Trump has actually been taking the drug himself, too. He started taking the drug, supposedly, after one of his personal valets tested positive for the Coronavirus, although again, there has never been any kind of systematic evidence that the drug is actually useful for preventing the virus. In fact, one recent story circulated of a woman who contracted the Coronavirus even after she took the drug in question for 19 years as a treatment for lupus, which it‚Äôs actually approved for and useful against.

The latest study covering tens of thousands of patients is not the first suggesting that hydroxychloroquine is linked to a higher risk of death among Coronavirus patients. One study outlining results from the VA hospital system has already revealed that among veterans, the drug was also linked to a higher risk of death among Coronavirus cases. None of these developments have seemed to faze the president away from his commitment to promoting his attempts at some kind of magic fix.

The U.S. is quickly approaching a total of 100,000 deaths due to the disease, and research came out from Columbia University in recent days outlining how tens of thousands of lives could have been saved if social distancing demands were enacted just a week or two prior to their actual implementation date, thereby stemming the spread of the virus earlier. In a new video ad released by the Biden campaign, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden hammers Trump as ‚Äútoo weak to lead‚Äù in the wake of the Coronavirus devastation that Trump has helped exacerbate via his inaction.

In the ad, a narrator says:

‚ÄòWhen Coronavirus came, Trump froze like a deer in the headlights. For months, the threats grew bigger, the warning signs became more ominous, the alarms flashed red, and there was our president: unprepared, indecisive, frozen, paralyzed by his fear of offending the Chinese government and losing his precious trade deal, panicked at the thought of what a stock market collapse would mean to his re-election, so he failed to act, and the virus got out of control.‚Äô

As the narrator also outlines, the Coronavirus has sparked tens of millions of unemployment claims as people have lost work all around the country amidst the desperate social distancing initiatives meant to try and stem the spread of the virus. Watch below, and hear the narrator also hammer Trump as ‚Äútoo weak to lead‚Äù:

The Coronavirus seems set to inevitably majorly weigh on the 2020 presidential election. Besides the fact that concerns about in-person voting safety or the lack thereof have driven elections officials towards developing procedural alternatives like expanded mail-in voting options, the virus is projected to possibly kill tens of thousands more Americans in coming weeks and months, according to sources like the University of Washington. Indeed ‚Äî the number of new Coronavirus infections recorded in the United States on a daily basis has remained staggeringly high, hitting a total of over 28,000 new infections this past Thursday alone. As long as new infections are recorded, new deaths will likely follow.

Biden has consistently led against Trump in polls on both the national level and the levels of individual swing states around the country. In a Fox News poll released just this week, Biden led on the national level by 8 percent.

New research has come out from Columbia University outlining that if social distancing demands had been enacted in the United States just a week or two earlier than their actual implementation date, tens of thousands of lives could have been saved via cutting off the virus‚Äôs exponential spread at an earlier point. On Twitter this Thursday, Hillary Clinton publicly called out Trump for leaving Americans to die.

WOW: New research from Columbia University finds if social distancing in U.S. ""had been in place seven days earlier‚Ä¶the U.S. could have prevented 36,000 deaths through early May ‚Äî about 40 percent of fatalities reported to date.""

She commented:

‚ÄòYesterday, Trump was asked what he would have done differently to avoid the U.S. accounting for 30% of the world‚Äôs COVID-19 cases. His response: ‚ÄúWell, nothing.‚Äù The real answer: By acting earlier, he could have saved tens of thousands of lives.‚Äô

Yesterday, Trump was asked what he would have done differently to avoid the U.S. accounting for 30% of the world's COVID-19 cases. His response: ""Well, nothing.""

According to the estimates, by May 3, over 50,000 lives could have been saved if social distancing demands were enacted two weeks prior to their actual implementation in the U.S. Over 30,000 lives could have been saved if social distancing demands were enacted just one week prior to their actual implementation. And yet, as Hillary noted, even as the Coronavirus death toll climbs into staggering levels, Trump continues to congratulate himself for a supposed job well done and insisted this week at the White House that he would not have responded differently to the pandemic, even with the benefit of hindsight.

Trump‚Äôs incompetent belligerence has cost tens of thousands of American lives. But he and his Republican buddies in Congress seem consistently more concerned with protecting their political power through means like the punitive subpoenas for Trump opponents that the Senate GOP has recently set in motion amidst the pandemic.

Acting as though the Coronavirus crisis that has killed tens of thousands of Americans is just some kind of crisis of positive thinking, she tweeted glibly this Thursday about the supposed ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù greatness or whatever that supposedly lies just beyond the challenges presented by the pandemic. In comments across the platform, Ivanka was promptly reminded of her own family‚Äôs role in exacerbating the very challenge whose gravity she seems to fail to grasp.

Originally, she tweeted:

What exactly is that even supposed to mean? The Coronavirus pandemic is not some kind of mundane ‚Äúchallenge.‚Äù The Coronavirus pandemic is a crisis which will soon have killed a staggering total of 100,000 Americans and could kill tens of thousands more in the weeks and months ahead, according to sources like the University of Washington.

If her father and the broader administration had worked to stem the virus‚Äôs spread in the weeks and months that the president spent dismissing the threat as supposedly irrelevant, the lives of Americans could have been saved. Instead, the U.S. is stuck with a sky-high death toll and a senior presidential adviser who thinks that tweeting nonsense inspirational quotes might be a good plan after all.
