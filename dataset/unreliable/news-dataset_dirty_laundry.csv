Even though President Trump has said that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandated at the federal level, there is still the possibility that some states may try to force them locally, which will put not just those opposed to vaccination in a tough position but also those who recognize the sanctity of unborn human life.

After it was announced recently that Canada’s largest federal research and development organization has teamed up with a Chinese vaccine company to test a new trial coronavirus vaccine in Canada, Dr. Alan Moy, M.D., founder and scientific director of the John Paul II Medical Research Institute and CEO of Cellular Engineering Technologies decided to do some digging, upon which he discovered that the test vaccine in question is made from aborted fetal cell lines.

CanSino Biologics Inc., also known as CanSinoBIO, is the name of the Chinese firm that partnered up with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) to conduct trials on Ad5-nCoV, as it is being called, which Dr. Moy found contains a cell line known as HEK293 that was derived from unborn children that were murdered while still inside their mothers’ wombs.

“Since it’s using an adenovirus replication-defective vector, it is using HEK293,” Dr. Moy told LifeSiteNews. “HEK293 is an aborted fetal cell line.”

What’s worse, Ad5-nCoV probably won’t even work

Besides its unethical origins, the Ad5-nCoV more than likely will not even work as promised, Dr. Moy warns. As it turns out, there is a high incidence of immunity against Ad5, so most of the people who are injected with it will confer no protection whatsoever against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“I don’t envy Canadians,” Dr. Moy is further quoted as saying. “Your government and PM (prime minister) have mandated draconian policies that are anti-life … Not a good vaccine solution if pro-life or pro-choice.”

What is further confounding is the fact that Canada would even agree to contract with a vaccine company based out of China, which is where this whole crisis originated. Ad5-nCoV was reportedly also co-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology which, like all other Chinese institutions, is governed and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

This vaccine is said to be the first “phase 2” coronavirus vaccine, meaning it has been approved to be “safely” used in human test subjects. And the Canadian government could not be more excited about the prospect of injecting as many Canadians as possible with it to “cure” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“NRC is proud of our ongoing partnership with CanSino Biologics,” stated NRC President Iain Stewart in a recent press release.

Dr. Xuefeng Yu, chairman and CEO of CanSinoBIO, also stated in the same press release that his company has “strong connections to Canada” and is “proud to be building on past successes and continuing our ongoing partnership with the NRC to address health needs on a global scale.”

Amazingly, both the NRC and CanSinoBIO are proud of their proprietary HEK293 aborted baby cell line, which they say will help “to advance a scale-up production process for the vaccine candidate.” In other words, thanks to these aborted babies, Canada and China will be able to produce Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for mass distribution much faster than normal, paving the way for a global vaccination campaign unlike anything the world has ever seen.

In the entire country, a record 38.6 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. That corresponds to nearly 25% of the entire United States labor force. While many of these folks are receiving unemployment from state and federal government, many others are not.

Millions of Americans — who watched states close non-essential businesses, subsequently crushing their careers — cannot even access unemployment benefits, according to the Economic Policy Institute. While some of these problems have been remedied, for others, collecting unemployment insurance was never an option.

Business owners who were unable to obtain an SBC loan or other forms of COVID-19 government subsistence have been frantically fighting to reopen their business as they watched their life savings go up in flames. The Free Thought Project has reported on multiple instances in which people unable to obtain government support have tried to reopen their businesses to support themselves, only to leave them in handcuffs. It’s a catch-22.

Of those millions of jobless claims in the United States, over a quarter-million of them were in the state of Oklahoma. With a population just under 4 million, 275,000 unemployed residents are massive. While some of these folks have likely sought out and found jobs to support themselves and their families, others have likely endured conditions that may have prevented them from doing so.

As a result of the state shutting down the economy, these unemployed residents of the state have been unable to pay their bills, including their rent and house notes. Now, in spite of the fact that this record spike in unemployment was a function of the state’s COVID-19 measures, Oklahoma is taking action in the form of evictions.

On their Facebook page this week, the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office announced that they will begin physically evicting residents unable to pay their bills. It reads as follows:

EVICTION NOTICE UPDATE We know that this will be difficult, but want to give as much notice as possible regarding OCSO deputies serving eviction notices. Deputies will start serving judicial eviction orders this week, and enforcing evictions on May 26, 2020. We understand how tough times are currently for many as a result of the health crisis the past few months, but we must enforce orders issued by the courts. Once the order is served tenants have 48-hours to leave the premises of the residence they are renting/leasing. Please, if you are set for an eviction hearing, attend. Make your case to the judge, the only person who can determine your case. Civil process, and our issuing evictions is mandated by state law: https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp… We will be compassionate, and respectful during scheduled evictions. We are hopeful that everyone issued an eviction will be able to make living arrangements.

Now, as the inevitable effects of the government’s shutdown order crash the economy and force people to choose between eating and paying their rent, that same government is going to start kicking them out of their homes.

See how that works?

As banks and other large corporations across the country receive hundreds of billions in Federal money — ensuring a lifetime of debt for future generations — Joe Sixpack on Main Street, USA is told to kick rocks.

RELATED: The Homosexual Rights Movement and Child Sexual Abuse

No one here is advocating for people to be able to squat and exploit this situation to get out of paying their house note or rent. However, that is not the case here. While grocery stores and fast-food restaurants are hiring, other businesses are told they must operate at 25% capacity or remain closed entirely. This is hardly sustainable when it comes to maintaining a decent workforce with substantial pay.

Unfortunately, this is likely the beginning of an economic snowball that will continue to grow as the next few months roll on. As TFTP has predicted from the beginning, the shutdown of the economy will have lasting consequences, unprecedented in nature, and that will be here for a long time. As this case in Oklahoma and countless other ones illustrate, the government’s promise of “safety” almost always ends in human suffering.

The agency noted that they do not have any specific safety concerns about the product, but said that they still needed to do some research to ensure that the tests were safe.

The program in question is known as the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) and they are now being asked to put their operation on hold until proper authorization is obtained. This also means that patients who have already sent in their tests will not be able to receive their results until the authorization has been given. SCAN is promising that this shut down is only temporary.

SCAN’s website stated that, “The FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN’s test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization.”

SCAN was sending out free test kits to potential patients, including people who were asymptomatic, hoping to obtain some data on how the coronavirus spreads through people who don’t show symptoms.

In a statement announcing the finer details of the program last week, Gates said that, “As SCAN gathers more test results in the weeks ahead, researchers expect the new data to provide a better sense of the number of infections and serve as one source to help answer other questions, like when physical distancing measures can be relaxed.”

However, an FDA shut down order came within days of the announcement, and the details behind the order are still unclear. The United States has been slow to get started with mass testing, especially of asymptomatic individuals, and the tests are mostly controlled by government agencies like the CDC. The tests currently available have also been criticized for being inaccurate. Just last week, the FDA issued a warning about tests made by Abbott Laboratories, saying that they often gave falsely negative results.

A hospital in Tennessee that has been closed for nearly a year received $121,000 in COVID-19 relief money from the people of the US, and that unconstitutionally, while still owing $1.2 million in federal income taxes.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, something else not authorized in the Constitution, the Rennova-owned Jamestown Regional Medical Center, which has been closed since June 13, 2019, received $121,722 in federal relief money from the unconstitutional coronavirus stimulus passed by Congress and signed by President Trump.

WTSP reports:

It’s not fair for them to direct money to a hospital that has currently no real ability to re-open and provide adequate and safe patient care,” former Jamestown nurse Miah Elmore said.

As the Rennova-owned hospital cashes taxpayer dollars, WBIR found it owes more than $1.2 million in unpaid federal taxes.

“It’s disgusting in a way,” former Jamestown nurse Karen Cooper said. “There are hospitals and things that are seeing the COVID patients that could’ve utilized that money.”

Cooper is part of a class-action lawsuit alleging Rennova did not pay Social Security or federal payroll taxes withheld from employee’s paychecks.

Rennova appears to be in deep financial trouble at the other two hospitals it runs, the Big South Fork Medical Center in Oneida and the Jellico Community hospital in Campbell County.

It is behind on federal taxes for both locations, with records indicating IRS liens of more than $4.4 million.

Despite the back taxes, Rennova said in financial filings last week the federal government gave it $7.4 million in taxpayer money through the coronavirus relief fund.

Did you get that?

The federal government unconstitutionally gave the corporation owning these hospitals $7.4 million of your money while they owed more than half of that in taxes!

Talk about crony capitalism!

It’s even worse than that.

The corporation also received another $2.3 million in payroll protection loans.

“While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loans, we cannot assure you that we will not take actions that could cause the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loans, in whole or in part,” Rennova said in a financial filing.

Can you believe that?

More than a week ago, HHS stated that it would “force repayment” of stimulus funds from closed institutions, but the real question is, why were they sent the funds in the first place if the hospital was closed?

Is anyone going to be held responsible, and I’m not necessarily talking about the hospital? I’m talking about the politicians that passed the unlawful legislation and the president that signed it?

Nope, cause everyone is just ok with thugs and thieves taking their money and spending it on things they never authorized them to spend it on.

This is not how you make American great.

It’s just another way that God is judging our country (Deuteronomy 28).

Of the 2,244 team members and contractors who work at the facility and were tested, 570 tested positive, the majority of whom did not show any symptoms and otherwise would not have been identified. The total comprises 237 individuals who were tested by the Department of Health or when seeking care through their own health care providers and an additional 2,007 individuals who were tested onsite from May 6 to May 9. Team members who test positive receive paid leave and may return to work only when they have met the criteria established by both the CDC and Tyson.

The Wilkesboro facility is among an initial group of more than 30 production facilities in the United States where Tyson is rolling out advanced testing capabilities and enhanced care options on-site to team members in partnership with MATRIX MEDICAL, a leading medical clinical services company, and other partners. The company is prioritizing communities with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 and will assess additional needs based on significant risk factors and access to testing.

As it is doing at the Wilkesboro facility, Tyson will disclose verified test results at other plants to health and government officials, team members and stakeholders as part of its efforts to help affected communities where it operates better understand the coronavirus and the protective measures that can be taken to help prevent its spread.

“We are working closely with local health departments to protect our team members and their families, and to help manage the spread of the virus in our communities,” said Tom Brower, Senior Vice President of Health and Safety for Tyson Foods. “We are using the most up-to-date data and resources to support our team members, and we are committed to ensuring they feel safe and secure when they come to work.”

Team members at Tyson’s Wilkesboro facility have access to daily clinical symptom screenings, nurse practitioners and enhanced education. AXIOM MEDICAL, a health care case management provider, will also track the symptoms of team members who test positive and provide additional care. Production has begun to ramp up at the facility, where operations were limited on May 14 to carry out additional deep cleaning.

Tyson has also put in place a host of protective steps that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance for preventing COVID-19. These include symptom screenings for all team members before every shift, providing mandatory protective face masks to all team members, as well as a range of social distancing measures including physical barriers between workstations and in break rooms.

“Our team members are essential to helping to feed the nation, and their health and safety is always our first priority,” said Kevin Taylor, Complex Manager for Wilkesboro facility. “Disclosing our testing results will help better protect our team members and help provide the wider Wilkesboro community with the information it needs to stop the spread of the virus.”

Tyson Foods has increased short-term disability coverage to 90% of normal pay until June 30 to encourage team members to stay home when they are sick. The company also has doubled its “thank you” bonus for its frontline workers. Team members who cannot come to work because of illness or childcare issues related to COVID-19 will continue to qualify.

But what if we told you that the true intent behind mass testing is to steal people’s DNA and store it away in government databases?

It might sound like some kind of crazy sci-fi flick, but hear us out. Back in late April when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was asked about what happens after a person is tested for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and whether the results “automatically go into some kind of database,” this was Cuomo’s chilling response:

“Yes, your result will be logged into both a state and county database through an electronic lab reporting system. The database includes your name.”

When further pressed about what a positive test result entails from the government’s standpoint, Cuomo explained that all newly infected are being ordered by their county health departments to quarantine for 14 days from the time of their most recent symptoms. They are also being asked to procure the names of anyone they may have come into contact with so that they, too, can be told to quarantine.

This directly ties into the contact tracing push from people like Bill and Hillary Clinton, who want an “army of contact tracers” to sweep the nation and hunt down anyone who might have been infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Be sure to listen to the following episode of The Health Ranger Report in which Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks to Dr. Judy Mikovits about these and other authoritarian measures being thrown at the people in response to this “plandemic:”

WHO official: A vaccine for coronavirus may never arrive

In addition to the typical swabbing protocol, another form of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) testing apparently involves taking blood samples by pricking people’s fingers, which the federal government is now implementing at pharmacies across America.

This combination of collecting both saliva and blood would seem to suggest that dark forces are perhaps trying to profile people’s genomes for some other purpose besides keeping them “safe” from a virus.

Keep in mind that there may never even be a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), at least according to Dr. David Nabarro from the WHO, a professor of global health at Imperial College London.

As it turns out, it is quite difficult to produce an effective vaccine for a virus, let alone one that continues to mutate and basically become new viruses. If a vaccine is, in fact, released, chances are it will not be effective nor will it be safe.

“There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against,” Nabarro is quoted as saying. “We can’t make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.”

Without a vaccine, experts are automatically predicting that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will never go away and instead become an annual event. And they are saying this while completely ignoring nutrition, supplementation, and other lifestyle changes that could easily protect the masses at a minimal cost.

“It’s absolutely essential that all societies everywhere get themselves into a position where they are able to defend against the coronavirus as a constant threat, and to be able to go about social life and economic activity with the virus in our midst,” Nabarro says.

Today’s vaccines are corrupted, untested and dangerous, and the vaccine industry is paying out billions of dollars to keep it all on the hush, hush.

You will never, ever see a case of the injured family on television or in any newspaper, talking about the nightmare of vaccine side effects, including autism, paralysis, coma and death. Here are the top 10 common sense reasons not to get vaccinated with anything, ever.

The real horror stories of today’s vaccines and the top 10 reasons to avoid them

There are lots of reasons to avoid the Franken-science of vaccines, namely:

Most vaccines, including any COVID-19 one they may come out with in the next 18 months, are rushed to market with no safety trials and no proof of efficacy from independent labs. Only the vaccine manufacturer is allowed to “test” it so they can skew results to whatever end justifies their “success.” Nearly all vaccines carry more risk than benefit, because they contain highly dangerous adjuvants, toxic emulsifiers, deadly preservatives, and genetically modified live viruses and bacteria from other animals, including humans (abortions). The COVID-19 virus has already mutated and morphed, and continues to do so, so even if a vaccine is created soon, it will be obsolete and useless, besides being dangerously rushed to market. It’s completely unpredictable, and the truth is that the scientists know that. The secretive vaccine “court” has settled with injured families for over $4 billion dollars (that’s 4,000 million folks) for vaccines, mostly influenza jabs, that routinely and permanently maim, deform and kill babies, children, adults, and senior citizens alike. These real-life horror story cases, settlements and claims are NEVER published by mainstream media. Autism rates have skyrocketed over the past two decades, and the former, senior lead scientist of the CDC, Dr. William Thompson, blew the whistle himself and confessed that the MMR vaccine causes autism, especially in black boys under the age of three. Think about that one for a minute. Most vaccines contain random infected cells from other animals, including from human abortions, dogs, eagles, pigs, cows and monkeys. Most vaccines contain aluminum, which catapults the harmful effects of toxic heavy metals, like mercury, making them more likely to cross your blood/brain barrier, causing brain damage and central nervous system disorders (the vaccine industry notoriously calls this “triggering immune response” but it’s very dangerous). For the first two weeks after getting a vaccine that contains a live virus, it is highly likely that you shed that disease and give it to those around you, so herd immunity is useless here and this is when the vaccine industry always unjustly blames those who don’t vaccinate. It’s called shedding (a.k.a. vaccine induced disease) and it’s scientifically proven to happen. New vaccines are expected to contain micro-chips (instead of serial numbers tattooed on your forearm) that embed under your skin to be used as tracers and trackers, and the ingredients to be released by Bill Gates’ computer software. What could possibly go wrong? Infertility drugs, SSRIs, and high doses of mercury are just a few examples of secret ingredients you might discover too late. With 5G networks bombarding humans with dirty electricity, pesticide-laden food being produced at an all-time high (think GMO and Roundup Ready crops), and with everybody suffering from lockdown syndrome (lowered immunity), any vaccine injections (cocktails of chemicals and live, unpredictable virus combinations) are just deadly accidents waiting to happen. Good luck with all of that.

If you don’t want to be vaccinated with Bill Gates’ untested, unsafe, micro-chipped COVID-19 vaccine, then you are branded “anti-science!”

The lead vaccine industry shill at the New York (Crimes) Times, Kevin “Health Noose” Roose, is strongly pushing for a coronavirus vaccine, without a shred of proof that any such vaccine is either safe or effective. Intelligent Americans who say no to being injected regularly with mercury, aluminum and live, attenuated viruses are not anti-science, or even anti-vax — they’re just anti-stupidity.

No person in their right mind thinks it’s smart to get injected with dirty vaccines just because the news cycle is blanketing the country with fear-mongering headlines every hour of the day. Many people who don’t get vaccines are pro-vaccine and are very science-based folks, but know that the industry is actually the most corrupt industry on Earth right now, with no regard to safety and that cannot be sued in court.

Realize that what the vaccine industry calls “side effects” are not side effects at all, but really DIRECT EFFECTS from the vaccination. If you get punched in the face and your teeth get knocked out, that’s not a side effect, that in fact, is a direct effect. Get it?

Bill Gates already admitted and bragged at a TED conference/seminar that if we do a “really good job” with vaccines, we can reduce the world’s population by a few billion. Yeah, how’s that working out for you, Bill?
