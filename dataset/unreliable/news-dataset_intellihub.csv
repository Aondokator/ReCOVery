(INTELLIHUB) — If H.R. 6666 is passed, the U.S. government will shell out $100 million grant money to faith-based organizations, clinics, medical centers, and other organizations that agree to perform testing for COVID–19 and tracing of exposure to COVID–19, according to a summary of the bill posted to Govtrack.us.

However, the bill’s official summary states that no provision in the bill would make testing or quarantining mandatory which couldn’t be further from the truth as we now have confirmation from President Donald Trump that the military and other forces are, in fact, being mobilized in advance to inoculate a good portion of the U.S. population by the end of 2020 when some 100,000 vaccines are delivered as Intellihub editor-in-chief Shepard Ambellas reported earlier on Friday in a piece titled Trump admits U.S. military, other forces, will vaccinate most Americans by 2021.

From the mouth of the president:

I think we’re going to have a vaccine by the end of the year–we’re doing very well with a vaccine and I will tell you something I just literally left a meeting–we’re mobilizing our military and other forces but we’re mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine. You know it’s a massive job to give this vaccine–our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we’re going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly–I just had that meeting. … We will have tremendous force, cuz, assuming we get it, then you have to distribute it and unless you’re mobilized and ready you’re not going to be able to do it for a long time so we’re starting now. We’re of the assumption that by the end of the year we’re going to have a vaccine, and then we have to be able to give it, to use it on most of our population.

Withal, we can now see the direction all of this is headed. The deep state is essentially using key Democrats to carry out the entire Rockafeller “Lockstep” plan once and for all and they appear to be making great headway at literally locking your step.

From Global Research:

Introduced by Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill) on May 1, the TRACE Act would establish a nation wide contact and quarantine program, has been referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee for a yet to be scheduled hearing before the Health Subcommittee. That subcommittee has a hearing scheduled for Thursday, May 14 on “Protecting Scientific Integrity in COVID 19 Response” with no published description of the hearing or list of witnesses. With 39 co-sponsors, HR 6666 could be rolled into a larger CV response legislative package yet to be introduced. HR 6666 grants $100 billion to the CDC (Center for Disease Control) to establish a local mobile health unit in each community to conduct a diagnostic door to door COVID 19 testing program. With the ACLU nowhere in sight, there is no doubt of HR 6666’s unconstitutionality as the Act states that such testing will take place “at individuals’ residences.” The bill goes on to establish the effort to ‘trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals and to support the quarantine of such individuals.’ In other words, TRACE not only allows a massive dragnet type effort to seek and find those infected in what may amount to enforced home invasions but to force compliance by requiring the names of all individuals an infected person has had contact with – all of which raises the constitutionality of the entire CV effort with the ultimate goal being mandatory worldwide vaccinations.

The New World Order is upon us. The Seven Seals have been broken and nobody is paying attention or standing up for what is right. Soon it will be too late.

Will the American people and the U.S. Constitution prevail or will the deep state use the Constitution for toilet paper when it all runs out?
