Natural disasters can raise pressing questions for religious believers who believe in a sovereign God. One question which inevitably arises is, “What is God doing in this?” For the almost 2 billion Muslims who make up a quarter of the world’s population, this is an important question. How might Muslims respond when they seek to frame a spiritual response to the pandemic? And what spiritual resources might their faith offer them in the face of this disruption to their lives?

For Muslims, there are specific religious obligations which social distancing requirements interfere with, especially communal prayer in mosques, pilgrimage, and washing the body of the dead.

Over recent months, most Muslim organizations around the world have been supporting social distancing measures brought in by their governments to control the pandemic. In Saudi Arabia Muslims were ordered not to perform their prayers at mosques, but to perform them in their own homes. The Australian National Imams Council issued a ‘Public Statement’ on 18 March, which gave Australia Muslims similar advice.

Islam offers a system of guidance for human behavior. Ordinary Muslims are expected to follow the guidance provided by those who are more knowledgeable about Islam than they, and ultimately the guidance issued should be based upon the Quran and the Sunna (the example and teaching) of Muhammad. These sources, to which legal reasoning is applied, are the foundation for the practice of Islam. Complying with this guidance is believed to bring benefits in this life and the next.

Most Muslim scholars would say that attending Friday communal prayers is obligatory for all Muslim men. The Quran instructs Muslims to leave their places of work on Friday and hurry to prayer (Sura 62:9), and there is a tradition of Muhammad which says that recording angels sit at the gates of mosques to keep track of all who attend (so their participation will be rewarded). But how to comply with this requirement during a pandemic?

To relax an obligatory requirement of Islam requires an exception which can trump the obligation. There is a principle in Islam that prevention of harm, especially to Muslim lives, can overrule other obligations. Thus the Australian Fatwa Council’s fatwa on COVID-19 applied the principle that “Islamic Sacred Law protects the life of a Muslim,” in order to grant an exemption to Muslims from attending communal prayers. The International Fiqh Academy, a peak global body of Muslim jurists, put it this way, in a statement delivered on 20 April, that under necessity, “Almighty God has allowed people do to what is forbidden, and to omit what is obligatory”. IFA’s comprehensive fatwa endorses such measures as closing businesses, using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, wearing masks and gloves, closing mosques, and generally adhering to the health directives issued by authorities, even if this interferes with Islamic requirements.

In relation to pandemic restrictions, of particular relevance are traditions of Muḥammad which refer to exemptions for attending mosques, and traditions which refer to contagious diseases. There is a tradition that during cold, windy wet weather, Muhammad instructed Muslims to pray in their homes. This establishes a precedent for an exemption to mosque attendance for health reasons. On the other hand, there is another tradition which could be taken as guidance to ignore contagious diseases. Muhammad is reported to have said, ‘There is no such thing as vermin (poisonous snakes, scorpions etc), contagious disease, or an evil omen.” Islamic traditions report some controversy among Muhammad’s companions concerning this statement. Some report that there was an additional balancing comment made that “the ill should not be taken to the healthy.” This second part of the tradition has been cited by Australian Imams and other Muslim leaders to support social distancing.

At stake here is a theological tension between the empirically observable principle of cause-and-effect, and a Islamic doctrine that everything happens according to the Divine Decree. Islamic teaching especially emphasizes that each soul dies at the precise time preordained by Allah. I remember an engaging discussion with Muslims in an Indonesian village early in 1980, about the fate of Marshall Tito of Yugoslavia, who was being kept alive on life support systems. The villagers had seen TV images of Tito in his hospital bed. Was it possible, they asked me, to prolong someone’s life past the time of death predetermined by Allah? It was made very clear to me that the correct Islamic answer was, ‘No it is not’. The influential Salafi sheik, Muhammad Saalih al-Munajid has observed that not even murder violates Allah’s sovereignty over the time of death: ‘the one who kills a person has not taken anything away from the lifespan of the one who was slain; rather Allah, may He be exalted, decreed that from eternity.”

The issue of divine sovereignty over epidemics also features in traditions in which Muhammad states that plague is sent by Allah, so “when you hear that it has broken out in a land, don’t go to it, and when it has broken out in the land where you are, don’t run out of it.” This might sound rather like a sensible restriction on travel for quarantine purposes, but in reality the logic is that if Allah is punishing a particular region with plague, it is senseless to try to evade his judgement, and if divine judgement is falling upon a region, it makes no sense to throw in your lot with them.

There is a telling discussion of this tradition reported in the Sahih Muslim. ‘Umar was leading Muslims on a raiding party to Syria when they received word that the plague had broken out there. Umar sought advice, and decided to turn back. Then a follower asked, “Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree?”, the implication being that it was futile to try to avoid a date with destiny set by the creator himself. Umar replied, “We are running from the Divine Decree to the Divine Decree.” He then gave the illustration that if you take camels into a valley, and there is green grass on one side and none on the other, whichever side you choose, it will be the Divine Decree. So to take steps to avoid plague must be considered as pre-ordained by Allah as dying from the plague after you get infected from entering plague territory.

No doubt with all this in mind, the Australian Fatwa Council’s ruling on COVID-19 began by asserting the sovereignty of Allah over death: “Life and death are absolutely within the decree of Allah alone, exalted be He. This is a reality, no matter what secondary causes appear to be.” The second paragraph continues, “No human shall die until it has completely exhausted its destined provision (rizq) and lifespan (ajal). Death is one of the decrees of Allah.” So if someone dies from COVID-19, it is because Allah has willed it. However, after asserting the principle of divine sovereignty over death, the fatwa defends attending to ‘secondary’ causes, such as infectious disease. Accepting the reality that Allah takes life by secondary causes is, the fatwa states, “part of our belief in the decree and destiny that Allah has established in the world.” So engaging with and acting in accordance with our understanding of ‘secondary’ causes is also the Divine Decree. Therefore, the fatwa urges, “a Muslim repels the decree of illness and transmissible diseases with the decree of protection, treatment and medicine.”

The Australian Imams were wise to urge Muslims to support the government’s policy of social distancing. Several early cases were reported from around the world where large gatherings of Muslims played a critical role in spreading COVID-19, including in Malaysia and India. In Indonesia it was reported in April that, at the instigation of Muslim leaders in the province, mosques continued to be open to thousands to attend Friday prayers together. One Acehnese congregant stated that she prefers to attend the mosque because ‘the reward is bigger [for praying in the mosque on Friday]… so no matter how afraid we are, most importantly is that we believe it is Allah’s provision’ and another suggested that “maybe by worshipping, Allah will keep the disease away from us.” She would rather trust in God’s sovereignty than miss out on the potential spiritual benefit of attending mosque.

There are risks for Muslims in applying certain Islamic teachings concerning epidemics. One risk is to emphasize the Divine Decree at the expense of the ‘Decree’ of preventative measures. According to a tradition attributed to Muhammad, plague may be a punishment for some, but for genuine believers it could be a source of mercy, so that if a believer trusts in the Divine Decree for his life during an epidemic, and he falls sick and dies, he will receive the reward of a martyr, i.e. paradise with all the options. Here is the full text of the hadith:

“I asked Allah’s Apostle about the plague. He told me that it was a Punishment sent by Allah on whom he wished, and Allah made it a source of mercy for the believers, for if one in the time of an epidemic plague stays in his country patiently hoping for Allah’s Reward and believing that nothing will befall him except what Allah has written for him, he will get the reward of a martyr.” (Sahih al-Bukhari)

This teaching might be considered an incentive to get infected, if it means attaining to the status of a martyr!

There is also theological pressure in the Quran, at the core of Islam, to see pandemics in terms of divine punishment. The Quran speaks repeatedly of the wrath of God falling on groups of people as punishment for rejecting past messengers. Quranic punishments include earthquake, fire, flood, windstorms, thunderbolts, and airborne projectiles. This emphasis is so pervasive, especially in the earlier, ‘Meccan’ passages of the Quran, that there can easily be a tendency to consider all natural disasters as acts of divine punishment. For example, when the Tsunami devastated South East Asia, the Saudi-based cleric, Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid announced it to be a punishment upon unbelievers for evil practices associated with holidays, such as adultery, drinking alcohol, and dancing: “the Almighty Lord … showed them his vengeance”.

A very practical risk for Muslims if they interpret epidemics as divine punishment is that they might not take necessary precautions against infection. This is a risk for the followers of the Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, who boasted that he and his followers have no need for social distancing: “We pray fives time daily … we stick together. We join hands. We eat from one bowl. We are doing very, very, very well. We have anti-virus. You have coronavirus, we have anti-virus.” Early on in the progress of the pandemic, as reports of COVID-19 devastation were coming in from China and then Iran, some Sunni Muslims clerics declared that this was God’s judgement against China for persecuting Muslims, and against Shia Muslims for being heretics. Those who assume that the epidemic is God’s judgement against other people could be tempted not to take adequate precautions themselves. Later, of course, the pandemic came for Sunnis too.

There are political risks for religious communities who do not observe health requirements. In India, Muslims were blamed by Hindu extremists for the spread of the virus. At one point, one in five confirmed cases in India was linked to a single three-day long meeting of the Tablighi Jamaat movement in New Delhi. After this event a government raid on the movement’s compound discovered the largest virus cluster in India. The authorities arrested 29 people, including 16 foreigners who attended the meeting, and as news of these events spread there were incidents of discrimination and hatred against Muslims across the country. (At the same time, the disruptions caused by COVID-19 have also provided opportunities for increased persecution of non-Muslims in some countries. For example, reports have been received from Pakistan that a NGO denied COVID-19 related food aid to poor Hindus and Christians, and a Muslim cleric boasted on Pakistan television that a destitute Christian was offered food in exchange for conversion to Islam. These actions have been called ‘reprehensible’ by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.)

We have seen repeatedly that large gatherings of people in close proximity, whether for sports, religious observance, parties, or even a choir practice, can turbo-charge the spread of COVID-19. Islam mandates for large gatherings of men in mosques, and afterwards these men potentially could spread the virus to their families. It is not an easy thing for Muslim communities to suspend communal gatherings, given that they play such a central role in Islamic spirituality. This is especially true of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Despite a hadith which states that angels prevent plague from entering Mecca and Medina, there have been multiple large-scale epidemics which decimated pilgrims: 20,000 pilgrims died of cholera in 1821 and 15,000 in 1865 (one sixth of all pilgrims that year). (However it is considered especially meritorious to pass away on the Hajj.) This year the Saudis have suspended the year-round umra pilgrimages to Mecca, and the Muslim world is still waiting for a decision from Saudi Arabia concerning the Hajj, which is due to commence in late July.

Islam offers a system of guidance, and Muslim leaders are speaking up all over the world to offer this guidance, addressing the many challenges caused by the pandemic. Most scholars are using their spiritual clout to instruct Muslims to follow guidelines issued by national authorities. This guidance is intended to release Muslims from the invidious position of being conflicted between religious requirements, and the requirements of the state. At the same time, there are theological drivers in Islam which could lead Muslims either to regard the pandemic as a punishment for non-believers, and thus not a serious risk for sincere Muslims, or to downplay the risk in favor of the perceived benefits of maintaining meritorious religious practices. Some Muslim communities may consider the tenets of their faith, including the requirement for men to gather for Friday prayers, to take precedence over anything a secular government might give them. The pandemic requires Muslim leaders to balance certain aspects of Islamic teachings with sensible medical advice, and when Islamic leaders do not align the guidance they are issuing with sound medical advice, the health outcomes for Muslims can be expected to be poor.

In countries which are trying to achieve compliance with pandemic measures, it is important to recognize that for many pious Muslims, religious requirements can take precedence over human-made laws of nations, if they interfere with core requirements of Islam. In order to secure the compliance of their Muslim citizens with health advisories and social distancing rules, the state needs Muslim organizations to issue guidance mandating the compliance of the faithful. There are risks, both for Muslims and rest of the community if this does not happen.

As of this writing, more than 80,000 Americans have contracted and died from the coronavirus. But how many have or will die from what some call ""despair""?

Consider the following call to my radio show:

""Hi, Larry. I was calling about people who have called suicide hotlines and different things with this loss of income. I am a widow of somebody who did commit suicide because of income. It was not now, during the epidemic, but it was because of dwindling income and hopelessness, which he hid from me. I had no idea this was going on in his business life. And I came home from work one day and found him hanging in the garage. He did leave a note about the different debts and things like that, but financial problems are a horrible thing — just a horrible thing that's worse than the virus.""

No doubt going back to work increases a person's chances of exposure to the COVID-19 virus. More will contract the virus and die from it than would have been the case under continued lockdowns. But this, of course, is not the full picture.

A new report, ""Projected Deaths of Despair During the Coronavirus Recession,"" suggests as many as 75,000 Americans could die from ""despair"" due to unemployment, depression from isolation, and fear of the indefinite and uncertain nature of the pandemic. One of the study's authors, Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust in Oakland, California, said: ""Deaths of despair are tied to multiple factors, like unemployment, fear and dread, and isolation. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were already an unprecedented number of deaths of despair. We wanted to estimate how this pandemic would change that number moving forward."" The study estimates that there could be 75,000 coronavirus-related ""deaths of despair"" from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide. Miller explained, ""The isolation is causing people to lose boundaries on their behaviors. ... People have to be working and we have to get people connected to other people.""

About the study, Dr. Elie Aoun, vice chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Addiction Psychiatry, said: ""I've been seeing this in practices and my colleagues have been talking about it, too. ... Addiction patients are relapsing, and a lot of patients who don't have drug use or alcohol problems are drinking more now, sometimes every day from 4 or 5 p.m., and they don't stop until they sleep.""

Earlier this year, I wrote about the connection between suicide and unemployment. A British journal, The Lancet Psychiatry, published a study associating worldwide suicides to unemployment. ""Our findings reveal that the suicide rate increases six months before a rise in unemployment,"" said study author Carlos Nordt. ""Our data suggest that not all job losses necessarily have an equal impact, as the effect on suicide risk appears to be stronger in countries where being out of work is uncommon."" The study said that between 2000 and 2011, there were an estimated 233,000 suicides in 63 countries, and that the number increased during the last recession: ""While the number of unemployment-related suicides increased by about 5,000 during the recent economic crisis in 2008, this analysis shows the risk of suicide among jobless people is high even in good economic times.""

Unemployment stands at 14.7%, with over 20 million Americans in April filing for unemployment. The number of unemployed Americans is likely understated. Betsey Stevenson, former member of the Council of Economic Advisers as well as the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor, says due to an incorrect classification of ""people who were employed (but) absent from work due to COVID-related reasons as temporarily unemployed,"" the actual number of unemployed is likely over 20%.

A new ESPN documentary about the Chicago Bulls' last championship season describes how Michael Jordan broke his foot early in his pro career, during the third game of the 1985-86 season. Defying his doctors' expectations, the foot healed faster than expected, and Jordan itched to return to the court despite team owner Jerry Reinsdorf's fear not only that Jordan could reinjure the foot but that such a reinjury could end his career. Reinsdorf said to Jordan, ""If you had a terrible headache, and I gave you a bottle of pills, and nine of the pills would cure you and one of the pills would kill you, would you take a pill?"" Jordan responded, ""It depends on how bad the f—-ing headache is.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci, eminence grise Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is America’s most prominent and vocal advocate of continued covid-19 “lockdown” policies. Inured to Dr. Fauci’s strident promotion of such draconian lockdowns, it was still jarring to hear his cynical, fearmongering suggestion, during a Senate hearing, Tuesday, May 12th. Fauci maintained that what students “really want to know” about their own safety, vis-à-vis covid-19, and school re-openings, is the availability of an effective vaccine—impossible by this fall.

…the idea of having…a vaccine available to facilitate the re-entry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far. We’re not talking about necessarily treating a student who gets ill but how the student will feel safe in going back to school. If this were a situation where we had a vaccine that would really be the end of that issue in a positive way. But…even at the top speed we’re going we don’t see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this term. What they really want is to know if they are safe…

Senator—and medical doctor (i.e., a Duke Medical Center trained practicing ophthalmologist)—Rand Paul’s cogent riposte to Dr. Fauci, in stark contrast, was a measured, evidence-based elucidation of reassuring facts about covid-19 among children, which the NIAID Director’s alarmist presentation disingenuously ignored.

…With regard to going back to school, one thing left out of that discussion is mortality. Shouldn’t we be discussing what the mortality of children [i.e., with covid-19] is? The mortality for zero to 18 approaches zero. It almost approaches zero. Between 18 and 45, the mortality in New York [City] was 10 out of 100,000 [now 18/100,000, i.e., 0.018%, for those 18-44]. So really we do need to be thinking about that. We need to think what happened in Sweden where the kids kept going to school. The mortality rate [in Sweden] is less than France. Less than Italy, Less than Spain. Less than Belgium. Less than The Netherlands. About the same as Switzerland. [Note: Actually less than the U.S. with simple age-adjustment given Sweden’s older population]. Basically, I don’t think there’s anybody arguing that what happened in Sweden is unacceptable…I think one size fits all is ridiculous. We ought to be doing it [re-opening] school district by school district and the power dispersed because people make wrong predictions. The history will be wrong prediction after wrong prediction starting with (disgraced hypocrite Neil) Ferguson in England…As much as I respect you (Dr. Fauci), I don’t think you’re the end all…If we keep kids out of school for another year what’s going to happen [is that] the poor and underprivileged kids are not going to learn for a full year. I think we should look at our kids getting back to school. I think it’s a huge mistake if we don’t open the schools in the fall.

Briefly, documentation from well-beyond New York City, just below, independently validates Rand Paul’s circumscribed claims.

--The Center For Disease Control and Prevention in its “COVIDView” 5/1/20 declared covid-19 hospitalization rates for children (0-17 years old) were “much lower than influenza hospitalization rates during recent influenza seasons.”

--A 5/11/20 JAMA report 46 from U.S. and Canadian Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) confirmed the rarity of serious pediatric covid-19 disease noting: “most PICUs across North America reporting no children admitted with this disease during the study period”; despite the fact that “more than 80% [of the small number admitted] had significant long-term underlying medical conditions”…most commonly “long-term dependence on technological support associated with developmental delay and/or genetic anomalies…overall survival and outcomes from critical illness in infants and children with COVID-19 was far better than reported for adult patients.” The authors concluded, “our data indicate that children are at far greater risk of critical illness from influenza than from COVID-19.”

--Stanford University Prevention Research Center’s Dr. John Ioannides, and colleagues, analyzed covid-19 mortality data as of April 4, 2020 from European countries and U.S. states, or major cities, with at least 250 [then] covid-19 deaths (total deaths included=25,692). An analysis pooling data from New York City, Italy, and the Netherlands, for example, revealed that only 0.9% of all deaths occurred in those < 65, without known underlying co-morbidities.

Moreover, Senator Paul’s limited time for discussion precluded mention of data repeatedly demonstrating--from Australia, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and France—that children, certainly those below 10-years old, are less likely to contract covid-19, and dramatically less prone to transmit the disease to others. Indeed, the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases (4/11/20) described a covid-19 infected 9-year old child, contact traced as part of a cluster of cases in the French Alps, who did not transmit the virus to 112 contacts at schools, or a ski class. “However” as the report noted, “the high proportion of picornavirus and influenza infections among his contacts at the schools indicated transmission of those viruses within those settings.”

Although Dr. Fauci’s response to Sen. Paul closed with a grudging and passing concession to “the numbers” in children, his initial comments riveted upon what has been aptly characterized as pediatric panic porn(ography).

Right now children [are] presenting with covid-16 (sic), covid-19, who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome very similar to Kawasaki’s Syndrome [Disease]. I think we better be careful that we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects. So again, I think you’re right in the numbers that children, in general, do much, much better than adults and the elderly…That’s why I am very reserved in making broad predictions.

Thus, even after Sen. Paul resoundingly debunked Fauci’s opening presentation alarmism, the NIAID Director had the temerity to raise the specter of “Kawasaki Syndrome” in children with covid-19, completely de-contextualizing this uncommon, and generally transient inflammatory condition’s well-established association to all manner of respiratory infections each year--including otherwise rather benign human coronaviruses that cause 15-30% of common colds! For example, a 2016 study published in one of the pre-eminent childhood illness journals, Pediatrics, found that 42% of 192 children admitted with Kawasaki Syndrome had a detectable respiratory infection, 7/192, or 3.6%, testing positive for one of three cold-causing human coronaviruses. Finally, a refreshingly sober 5/9/20 perspective on the ginned up covid19-Kawasaki Disease hysteria Dr. Fauci was content to fan, based upon review of 100 purported “cases,” concluded the syndrome was “rare, “children seem to improve rapidly,” “and children are probably still spared from most morbidities and mortality linked to COVID-19 infection.”

Contra the prevailing hard left-dominated “mainstream” media caricature, President Trump weighed in (during a 5/14/20 interview with Maria Bartiromo) thoughtfully, if firmly, on the matter of school re-opening, and rejected Dr. Fauci’s opinion:

[~2:37-3:01] Young people are very little affected by this (covid-19). We have to get the schools open…I totally disagree with him (Fauci) on schools.

Acknowledging the lethal havoc covid-19 had wrought upon the vulnerable elderly, “the elderly have been decimated,” the President added this reasonable caveat:

[~14;35-15:05] Open the schools. But if a teacher is 65 or older, especially if they have diabetes, if they have a bad heart, if they have a (medical) problem, we say relax for a longer period of time. But if you look, there’s been very little damage done to people that are healthy and young, and frankly medium age people.

Poisoned with their own deranged hatred of POTUS Trump, which renders them impenetrable by fact, “mainstream” media sneered its collective disapproval of his remarks (examples here; here: here).

Notwithstanding Dr. Fauci’s factually-challenged covid-19 pediatric panic stoking, reflexively amplified by the media chorus of apocalyptic covid-19 brayers, school re-openings are burgeoning across Europe (including Denmark; France; The Netherlands; Switzerland; Greece; Croatia; Serbia; and Slovenia), Australia—and Montana, here in the U.S. Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Nick Coatsworth, published an eminently rational justification for the nation’s school re-opening policy on 5/3/20. Coatsworth observed,

When school closures were initially proposed to control an epidemic, planners had influenza in mind. Flu spreading within schools and children are the main source for transmission in the community. But COVID-19 is not the flu. Far fewer children are affected by COVID-19, and the number of transmissions from children to children and children to adults is far less… As an infectious diseases specialist, I have examined all of the available evidence from within Australia and around the world and, as it stands, it does not support avoiding classroom learning as a means to control COVID-19.

He concluded by contrasting these marginal to unknown “benefits” on covid-19 disease transmission, with the self-evident deleterious social effects of school closures:

Firstly, the disruption to routine and socialization, while temporary, tends to have a disproportionate effect on our more vulnerable children, including those with disability or particular learning needs. School is a critical element of good health across all age ranges. Secondly, it increases stress within the family environment, with parents having to juggle home schooling and work. Sixty-two percent of Australian families have two working parents. Parents extend their working day into the evening to compensate for the need to home school.

Would that Dr. Fauci was a public health official possessed of such sober wisdom. Americans, instead, must disregard Fauci’s covid-19 pediatric panic porn, and demand that U.S. schools be re-opened selectively, now, and full re-opened by late summer.",17.5,Low,Right

The NHS and socialized medicine, despite being cheered during this crisis, continue to be horrible.

And the dependency on immigrant workers, who appear to be more susceptible to the virus, may have worsened the crisis in these hospitals, just as they are believed to have done in Swedish nursing homes, as I discussed in, ""Sweden Cared More About Islamophobia Than Saving Elderly in Nursing Homes From Coronavirus.""

As previously noted, most of the UK health care doctors and medical staff who died of the virus are minorities. What role did they play in spreading the virus in hospitals?

An estimated 44 percent of doctors in Britain are from ethnic minority backgrounds, significantly higher than the 13 percent in the population at large. Last year, more than half the new doctors who registered in Britain were born overseas. But experts say it’s still baffling that 93 percent of the doctors who have died of covid-19 were ethnic minorities.

Again, the British dependency on foreign doctors proved to be disastrous. What role did foreign staff play in the US nursing home outbreaks?

2. The infection rates in some UK hospitals have serious implications for the mass deaths in US nursing homes.

Up to a fifth of patients with Covid-19 in several hospitals contracted the disease over the course of the pandemic while already being treated there for another illness, NHS bosses have told senior doctors and nurses. Some of the infections were passed on by hospital staff who were unaware they had the virus and were displaying no symptoms, while patients with coronavirus were responsible for the others. The figures represent NHS England’s first estimate of the size of the problem of hospital-acquired Covid-19, which Boris Johnson last week said was causing an “epidemic” of deaths. In a national briefing last month on infection control and Covid-19, NHS England told the medical directors and chief nurses of all acute hospitals in England that it had found that 10%-20% of people in hospital with the disease had got it while they were inpatients.

How do those rates apply to US hospitals and nursing homes? That's the big question.

The UK numbers show that there's a major risk of patients in facilities contracting coronavirus. Residents in nursing homes where standards are lower, staff often less well trained, and residents much more vulnerable would potentially have a higher death rate.

Beyond that, there is the big question of policies by Democrat governors, Cuomo, Murphy, Whitmer, and Newsom, among others, to send coronavirus patients to nursing homes. The UK numbers give us a sense of just how badly coronavirus can spread, first in hospitals, and then in other facilities, which gives us a sense of how catastrophic these policies were.

Cuomo has argued that no one should be prosecuted for nursing home deaths because they would have died anyway. “Older people… are going to die from this virus,” he argued, dismissing the outrage of the families of the dead. “I don't think there's any logical rationale to say that they would be alive today.” ""We've tried everything to keep it out of a nursing home, but it's virtually impossible,"" he falsely claimed.

That is clearly untrue.

The UK numbers only deepen the indictment.",17.5,Low,Right

And he won't stop. The mere fact that 81% of coronavirus deaths in Minnesota have occurred in nursing homes won't even slow his grandma-killing administration down. Anyone with a conscience would stop, good thing Walz is a real lefty.

Despite the devastating death toll, Minnesota nursing homes are still being allowed by state regulators to admit coronavirus patients who have been discharged from hospitals. Early in the pandemic, the Minnesota Department of Health turned to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to relieve the burden on hospitals that were at risk of being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Minnesota hospitals have since discharged dozens of infected patients to nursing homes, including facilities that have undergone large and deadly outbreaks of the disease, state records show.

Hospitals were never overwhelmed. This lockdown fetish killed horrifying numbers of seniors instead.

urrently, even poorly rated nursing homes with large and deadly clusters of coronavirus cases have been allowed to admit COVID-19 patients from hospitals. One such facility, North Ridge Health and Rehab in New Hope, has accepted 42 patients from hospitals and other long-term care facilities since mid-April even as the coronavirus has raged through its 320-bed nursing home, killing 48 of its patients and infecting scores more. “It makes no sense to bring more COVID-19 patients into facilities that have already failed to protect them,” said Sen. Karin Housley, the Republican chairwoman of the Senate Family Care and Aging Committee. “If it were my mom or dad in one of these facilities, I would be really worried.”

Well she's a Republican. Democrats understand that killing senior citizens is a pathway to justify more lockdowns and get more votes.

State health officials and long-term care industry representatives have defended the practice of discharging some COVID-19 patients to nursing homes, saying it is part of a broader strategy to conserve critical hospital beds during the pandemic.

Gotta conserve those empty hospital beds for the patients you don't have and aren't allowed to treat, in order to kill seniors.

Statewide, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus has killed more than 600 Minnesotans at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. That is a staggering 81% of the deaths from the pandemic statewide.

I touched on it while writing about immigrant workers in Swedish nursing homes.

In early April, some medical experts estimated that Somalis represented 40% of the coronavirus deaths in Stockholm and 18% of the death toll in Sweden. That may be because of Stockholm’s first 15 coronavirus deaths, 6 of those who died were Somalis. The Somalis have been followed by Iraqis, Syrians, and Afghans as being significantly overrepresented among the ranks of coronavirus cases. In early April, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health revealed that immigrants made up 1 in 5 cases of the virus and that 1 in 100 Somalis in Norway had tested positive for the virus. A week later, it was 1 in 4. Somalis made up 6% of confirmed cases. And in Helsinki, Finland, Somalis accounted for 17% of cases. The coronavirus is a recent phenomenon and we don’t have all the answers as to why some groups appear to be more vulnerable to it than others. Researchers have proposed varying explanations for Somali vulnerability from ethnic benign neutropenia, to low vitamin D levels, dense living conditions, intergenerational households, high rates of smoking, and poor language skills.

And now some data points from the UK.

Nearly all the doctors who have died of covid-19 in the United Kingdom have been ethnic minorities, most born overseas, like el-Tayar, according to the British Medical Association. That grim toll has confounded health experts, alarmed minority physicians, and startled a nation that relies on immigrants to swell the ranks of its public health-care system

Relying on them might not be a good idea, especially considering the rate of coronavirus infections in hospitals which may be as high as 1 in 5.

An estimated 44 percent of doctors in Britain are from ethnic minority backgrounds, significantly higher than the 13 percent in the population at large. Last year, more than half the new doctors who registered in Britain were born overseas. But experts say it’s still baffling that 93 percent of the doctors who have died of covid-19 were ethnic minorities.

It is baffling. It shows that there's still plenty we don't know about the virus.

People of African and Middle Eastern origin do appear to be more susceptible to the disease. Some of the doctors in question however were from Pakistan and India.

According to a Guardian newspaper analysis, more than 180 health workers have died of covid-19, the majority of them ethnic minorities. Another analysis of 106 National Health Service deaths found that two-thirds were among ethnic minorities.

These numbers are striking. And looking deeper into what they mean would be more helpful if the media didn't, as usual, pivot to false claims of racism.

The NHS numbers do seem to show a high rate of Asian deaths among NHS workers. Unlike the US, this is more likely to mean Pakistani. Health care workers born in the Philippines however seemed to have the highest death rate.",17.5,Low,Right
