North American culture practically worships the pharmaceutical industry and often fails to recognize many of the issues within it. Many Americans are completely unaware that new prescription drugs have a 1 in 5 chance of causing serious reactions, even after being approved.

In fact, approximately 1.9 million people are hospitalized annually due to properly prescribed medication (not including any overdoses, self-prescriptions, or mis-prescribing). 128,000 people die every year in the U.S. from drugs prescribed to them, so why is this still happening? The reality is, drug companies make a lot of money from selling prescriptions, and they even pay doctors to do it for them.

If you’ve ever questioned this industry and your doctor’s motives, here is some good news: You can now find out how much your doctor is paid annually to prescribe any drug. In addition, you can also search any company name and find out how much they pay doctors in total every year.

The Database That’s Exposing Big Pharma’s Money Trail

The governmental website Open Payments Data

The two former options allow you to see how much doctors and hospitals are paid annually by pharmaceutical companies to prescribe drugs. If you search a specific company, on the other hand, you can see a detailed summary of their spendings. There’s specific information outlining which doctors are paid the highest amounts, how many doctors they pay nationwide, the nature of these payments, and then specific details of every single payment they made to doctors that year.

For example, when you type Big Pharma giant Gilead Science Inc. into the tool bar, you can see that the company spent $36,830,535.40 in Total General Payments and $45,394,349.76 in Total Research Payments in the year 2015 alone. 48.4% of payments were classified as “Compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program.” The top paid physician made more than $600,000 in 2015 from simply prescribing drugs manufactured by Gilead Science Inc.

It doesn’t take much common sense to understand what this could mean, particularly since it’s hardly a secret that pharmaceutical companies essentially buy out the medical industry. Numerous pharmaceutical companies have paid doctors and researchers to understate the dangers of both drugs and their negative side effects, and to falsify research as well.

Arnold Relman, Harvard Professor and former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, put it perfectly when he said, “The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. . . . The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it’s disgraceful.”

Don’t Be So Quick to Blame Your Doctor…

If you’ve visited Open Payments Data‘s platform and searched your doctor within their database, take a moment to reflect on what you’re really looking at. Just because your doctors receive payments from pharmaceutical companies doesn’t necessarily mean they’re terrible people; it could just mean that they’re doing their jobs.

It’s unlikely your personal doctor designed the current structure of the medical industry. Your doctor may not even understand the complexity of the pharmaceutical industry because MDs aren’t properly educated on these drugs. Many doctors genuinely believe they’re helping people through the use of medication; they don’t see the bigger picture here because it’s not included in their education. Plus, it’s often illegal for MDs to prescribe natural cures instead of pharmaceutical drugs and conventional treatments, particularly when it comes to the cancer industry (check out this CE article that exposes the truth about cancer).

In addition, when you actually think about it, it makes perfect sense that some doctors are being paid by pharmaceutical companies. Of course Big Pharma would require doctors’ help in creating drugs and validating their use; it’s completely legal and should be expected of them. However, there’s clearly a grey area here that cannot be ignored.

Pharmaceutical companies, rather than qualified and unbiased doctors, define a lot of the information that MDs are taught, and Big Pharma often influences medical professors and funds university programs. For example, 1,600 Harvard professors stated that they or a family member have ties to drug companies that could bias their teachings or research. The pharmaceutical industry donated more than $11.5 million to Harvard in 2008 for “research and continuing education classes.” Many Harvard students have expressed concern over this and it even made mainstream news when a student was belittled by his professor for asking about the side effects of a drug his professor was unlawfully promoting in class.

This has also been a prevalent issue within psychiatry. As Dr. Irwin Savodnik of UCLA explains, “The very vocabulary of psychiatry is now defined at all levels by the pharmaceutical industry.” This is partially because the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the text most psychiatrists in the U.S. refer to to diagnose and treat their patients, is heavily biased toward using pharmaceutical drugs instead of therapy. Read more about this in our CE article here.

If you haven’t yet been exposed to this side of the U.S. medical industry, I can understand that there may be some confusion. Why would pharmaceutical companies and some doctors conspire to over-prescribe or mis-prescribe people when their sole purpose should be to help their patients? The simple answer is profit.

The main reason we take so many drugs is that drug companies don t sell drugs, they sell lies about drugs. This is what makes drugs so different from anything else in life… Virtually everything we know about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our doctors… the reason patients trust their medicine is that they extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines they prescribe. The patients don’t realize that, although their doctors may know a lot about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know very, very little about drugs that’ve been carefully concocted and dressed up by the drug industry… If you don t think the system is out of control, please email me and explain why drugs are the third leading cause of death… If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been caused by a new bacterium or a virus, or even one-hundredth of it, we would have done everything we could to get it under control. – Dr. Peter Gotzsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration (source)

Why Big Pharma Wants You To Take Pills

This may be obvious to many of you, but, just to be clear: The entire medical industry is focused around profit. It’s similar to any other industry in that every service it provides you with, or item it convinces you to purchase, makes someone else a lot of many. In the case of a pharmaceutical company, they can only make money if you’re sick.

So, it wouldn’t really be in the best interest of Big Pharma to sell drugs without any negative side effects. If they produced drugs that actually 100% cured people, how would they continue to profit off our illnesses?

This is precisely why Big Pharma does not get involved with all-natural medicines; there is no profit to be made in plants. Anyone can grow a plant with the right climate and it’s much cheaper to manufacture than synthetic drugs. It’s also easier to make pills in larger quantities than plants. and then when you consider the economies of scale, Big Pharma is able to generate an even greater profit.

Big Pharma has infiltrated pharmaceutical drugs into other industries too. If you eat animal products, then you’re inadvertently ingesting the hormones, antibiotics, and other pharmaceutical drugs given to those animals. Antibiotics, birth control pills, painkillers, and other pharmaceutical drugs can be found in tap water as well.

Let’s take a moment to look at the bigger picture: Most industries are currently driven by money, not passion. It seems strange, but this is precisely the issue within the medical industry. I’m sure many doctors choose their occupation because they’re passionate about helping people. However, until Big Pharma stops playing such a crucial role in creating their job descriptions, it will be difficult for MDs to actually help people without simultaneously hurting them.

It’s clear that we need a systemic change in values. Until we start to work “for the people” rather than “for the profit,” we cannot expect these outcomes to change. It’s hardly surprising that Big Pharma wants you to be sick because they’re not just in the business to cure people — they also need to make a profit.",12.5,Low,Right

This has been a common theme throughout the US as well as the World.

Reflect On: Is the new coronavirus being made out to be more dangerous than it actually is? Are the death numbers even accurate? Why has there been so much controversy and so much evidence of foul play?

The idea that deaths being attributed to the new coronavirus are greatly inflated has been a common theme all around the world for the past month or so, and it’s gaining even more traction. There are many reasons why this belief has been circulating, and one of them is the fact that health professionals, as well as those within politics, have been emphasizing this point.

For example, not long ago Dr. Ngozi Ezike, Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health stated that, even if it’s clear one died of an alternative cause, their death will still be marked as a COVID death. She explained that this is how coronavirus deaths were being calculated and was quite clear about it.

Vittorio Sgarbi, an Italian politician and Mayor of Sutri gave an emotional speech at a hearing on the 24th of April. He emphasized that the number of deaths in Italy due to COVID-19 are completely false and that the people are being lied to so that the government could impose more authoritarian measures on the citizenry. According to a study out of Italy, 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities that were examined specifically for this study were people who suffered from previous medical conditions. More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease. The study provides insight as to why their death rate may be much higher compared to other countries.

The point is, there are a number of examples as to why coronavirus deaths around the world might be very inflated. What’s listed above isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. You can read more about this topic and other examples I’ve written about, here.

The Colorado Example

The latest example of this comes from state Rep. Mark Baisley, who asked asked 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler to investigate whether the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) broke the law by classifying several deaths at a Centennial senior living facility as coronavirus deaths when they really weren’t the result of the coronavirus, as first reported by 9News. In a separate report by CBS4, Montezuma County Coroner George Deavers said CDPHE classified an alcohol-poisoning death in his county as a coronavirus death. Both men accused CDPHE of changing death certificates to add COVID-19.

“Falsely inflating the number of deaths due to COVID-19 adversely impacts the professional reputation of nursing homes, hospitals and healthcare workers while creating undue fear for families.” – Baisley

The number of deaths attributed to the coronavirus in Colorado recently passed 1,000, but after these accusations were made by Baisely, the CDPHE has stated that the number does not actually represent the number of people that have died due to the new coronavirus.

Are they simply trying to cover their tracks? Were they instructed to classify deaths as a result of the new coronavirus just because someone who dies of another cause simply dies with the coronavirus? Are they simply correcting and clarifying confusing data? Why is there so much confusion? Why are death numbers including people who didn’t actually die as a result of COVID-19? Why are changes being made to the Colorado numbers only when these facts are being brought to light, and are the revised numbers even accurate?

According to Dr. Eric France, CDPHE’s chief medical officer, the state’s surveillance-system reporting is in line with federal guidance and matches how other states are also reporting deaths. He also said that changes to clarify its public death-reporting have changed. The CDPHE has announced that going forward, cases in which people had COVID-19 and died of another cause will be recorded separately from the deaths that were caused by COVID-19.

But how many deaths have been attributed to this disease have already been used for the “official” statistics?

The issue even drew a pointed response from Gov. Jared Polis at his own news conference on Friday. “What the people of Colorado want to know is not who died with COVID-19, but who died of COVID-19,” said Polis.

Another interesting thing to note is that multiple studies have found that the infection rate of the new coronavirus is significantly higher than what’s been recorded, meaning that the infection fatality rate, according to these studies, is in the same ball park as seasonal influenza. With death numbers also coming into question, fewer deaths from the coronavirus would drive infection fatality rate even lower.

Furthermore, controversy has surrounded the testing kits, many have been found to be contaminated with the virus and other bacteria, and the Tanzanian president expressed that fruit they tested with the kits came back as positive, hinting to foul play and corruption.

The Takeaway

Never in history have we seen so much controversy surrounding a major global event since 9/11. Edward Snowden also recently expressed that many measures were put into place after 9/11 that still remain until this day, sharing his belief that governments are using the coronavirus to push even more authoritarian measures upon the citizenry. You have to ask yourself, why are some of the world’s leading scientists/epidemiologists in the field, as well as many doctors, getting censored for simply sharing their research and opinions. Why are their YouTube videos taken down, and why have people like Bill Gates become the official health authority regarding the coronavirus, what’s going on and the actions humanity should implement? This alone should raise a red flag for people.

I’ve said it many times, and I’ll say it again, there is a digital authoritarian Orwellian “fact-checker” going around the internet and censoring so much information. This effort is combined with a digital campaign of hate and absolute ridicule of anything that provides an opposing view/narrative in order to sway minds and control human consciousness.",12.5,Low,Right
