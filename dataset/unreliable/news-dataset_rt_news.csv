He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics

Sweden has found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholmers have antibodies for coronavirus, despite the country’s laissez-faire handling of the outbreak. The mainstream media think this proves them right. It doesn’t.

Just last week, I criticized a piece of reportage in the Guardian, that grand old publication, for its remedial understanding of coronavirus. They are at it again, this time holding up an antibody study as evidence that Sweden, a land of dangerous wrong-think, is killing people with its coronavirus policy.

First, let us deal with the study itself. It reported that, based on antibody tests – which are supposed to detect people who have had and cleared the coronavirus – far fewer Stockholmers had had the virus than thought, which would mean that Sweden has a long way to go to reach herd immunity. But the thing about antibody tests is that they are utterly unreliable.

There is no way to know what proportion of infected people generate antibodies. And even if they all do, we don’t know how accurate the tests are in detecting them. Therefore, as Professor Sunetra Gupta of the University Oxford confirmed on Thursday, the figure that comes out of an antibody test is a lower bound of the proportion of people who have been infected. A more honest reporting of the data would have read “At least 7.3 percent of Stockholm had Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April.”

Sweden turns heel

In order to turn on their usual social democratic idols Sweden, the Guardian has had to spin harder than a hamster on a wheel. They have decided to find a metric on which Sweden can be made to look bad, and they have chosen to compare its deaths per million to the other Nordic countries. Deaths per million is a laughably crude metric that takes no confounding factors into account – least of all the wildly different reporting countries use for Covid deaths. At the bottom of the Guardian’s graph is a disclaimer reading: “Note: counting methods vary by country.”

Sweden does score higher than Denmark, Norway and Finland on that particular metric, due in large part to their failure to keep the virus out of nursing homes. But in order to ascribe this difference to Sweden’s decision not to shut down their economy, the Guardian must establish that France, the UK, and above all Belgium – well above Sweden in deaths per million – have been even more laissez-faire than Sweden regarding the virus. But of course this is impossible.

They appear to have found a Swedish Guardian reader, one Bjorn Olsen of Uppsala University. Olsen, taking the 7.3 percent antibody result at face value, and being a man of some education, has calculated that this is rather far away from the 50 or 60 percent required for herd immunity. “I think herd immunity is a long way off,” tooted the professor of infectious medicine.

But Sweden is not aiming for herd immunity, as their state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell keeps telling people. They are simply ensuring that hospitals do not become overwhelmed, rather than being scared of the second wave. You know, as was the point all along. When, by the way, did that go out the window? Wasn’t all of this done on the pretext of not inundating hospitals with too many patients at once?

Less rationalism, please

I’ll give them this: the Guardian has a knack of unearthing quirky opinions. Another of their popular Sweden articles, which almost has to be read to be believed, is by Tae Hoon Kim, a South Korean based in Stockholm. Kim moans that he is “worried” and “not reassured” by the Swedish government’s virus-wrangling.

Kim also thinks that Sweden’s “tendency to regard coronavirus just as a serious public health problem… something that requires the careful observance of rules set out by health experts” has got them into trouble. Instead, he prefers to think of the loop of RNA as “an ‘invisible enemy’… an existential problem that calls for the state to suspend civil liberties.”

Also on rt.com Why is the MSM working overtime to try to show that Covid-19 is dangerous to CHILDREN - when so few of them have died?

Perhaps Kim would feel more comfortable in, er, I don’t know, South Korea? There, the government would know his exact whereabouts at all times via a compulsory app on his phone, and he would have to tell them the nature of his business everywhere he went. But what do I know? Maybe Kim is right, and we do need more woo-woo philosophizing and op-ed psychobabble. Perhaps a few more celebrity renditions of Kumbaya? As long as we’re spitballing…

Swedes 1, Turnips 0

It is remarkable that even in a year with no Eurovision, Sweden has managed to make such a splash in the Western media. It is fascinating to watch them tie themselves in knots as they try to reconcile their image of Sweden as a progressive paradise with their new notion of a Scandinavian banana republic running a callous Darwinian experiment in which the old are sacrificed for the empty pleasures of the young.

Oh, how the MSM would have loved it if the one country to deviate from conventional wisdom had been Hungary, or the Philippines, or best of all, Russia. How much easier the smear job would have been had it been some poor, backward Latin American or Asian country, or anywhere run by a “literally Hitler” strongman-type politician. But they had no such luck; sensible, freethinking Sweden had to go and deviate from the party line.

No matter how much the MSM bury their heads in the sand, Sweden is running the safest, most responsible reaction to the outbreak in a world gone mad. The real experimenters are the lockdown evangelists. They are the ones playing with people’s lives, and it is high time they accepted that responsibility.

China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed zero new cases of the virus on Saturday – a first since the country began tallying infections in January – and reported only two suspected cases, one of them imported from abroad.

The lethal illness first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading across the country to infect some 84,000 people, killing in excess of 4,600. But with aggressive containment measures that put tens of millions of citizens under strict lockdown, Beijing appears to have largely brought the contagion under control, reporting a only slow trickle of new cases as the virus took hold elsewhere in the world.

While the United States remains the top epicenter with more than 1.6 million infections, South America has quickly overtaken other regions for the number-two spot, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning of a dramatic spike in cases there.

“In a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease,” Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergencies expert, told a press conference on Friday, noting that Brazil is “clearly the most affected.”

Over the last week in Brazil, health officials have reported tens of thousands of new infections each day, bringing its current disease toll to more than 330,000, rapidly eclipsing Russia as the second-worst-affected nation. Brazil has also counted more than 21,000 fatal cases, nearly seven times more than Peru, the region’s next hardest-hit country.

Though no vaccine, or even a reliable treatment, currently exists for the coronavirus, Brazilian authorities have approved widespread use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a therapy, after receiving shipments of raw materials for the chemical from India last month. The drug has shown early promise as a treatment, but its effectiveness has yet to be proven in a clinical setting. A new study in the Lancet journal, meanwhile, suggests the medicine could cause heart complications and even death, showing little or no benefit to Covid-19 patients.

Since the pandemic broke out last December, more than 5.2 million people have been sickened and some 338,000 killed worldwide, making it one of the deadliest viral outbreaks since the 1918 Spanish Flu.

Times of crisis bring people together under a common cause – says the propaganda of the blind optimist. What we’ve actually seen during the coronavirus pandemic is society divide into different tribes; here are five of them.

The Remain-at-Homers

This group will not leave their homes no matter what, as a matter of principle. By pure coincidence they also tend to have the biggest houses and largest gardens, and jobs they can do comfortably from their well-equipped studies. It’s not self-discipline getting them through lockdown, but pure smugness – which you can see on their face when they gleefully tell you, via Zoom, how long it’s been since they left the house in much the same manner a veteran might describe landing on Omaha Beach or defending Stalingrad.

The Anti-Lockdowners

This lot can be heard saying things like, “it’s just a nasty cold,” or “grandad was going to die anyway.” However they justify it, they’re just not interested in being forced to stay at home. You’ll see them angrily protesting for their right to get a beer and a haircut... or perhaps you’ll see them in the hospital on a ventilator recovering from a nasty cold.

The Hypocrites

The Hypocrites are a strange mix of Remain-at-Homer and Anti-Lockdowner. These virtue signallers will keep up the smug facade of those who are following all the rules by staying at home to watch Netflix. However, don’t be fooled because they’re also going shopping for essential supplies three times a day and exercising twice a day, despite the fact that they hadn’t even run for a bus in two decades before all this started. Yep, they spend more time outside than they used to!

The Snitches

And then there are the Snitches. These are your neighbours who spend the whole day longingly staring out the window dreaming of freedom, but as soon as they see you walk out the front door to buy bread and booze, they call the police to get you properly locked down. Solidarity has its limits.

The Conspiracists

These are the people who think Covid-19 is a Bill Gates plan to force you to buy Windows 27. Or that the government is just trying to wipe out pensioners. Or that 5G is downloading the virus straight into your brain in an impressive two seconds as long as your cell plan is up to date. Whatever the theory, as long as there is no proof, they’ll tell you all about it. Via Zoom.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on Friday, Nurse claimed that he believed that the UK government has not responded effectively to the outbreak of Covid-19.

Nurse - who won a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2001 – even asked who's really in charge of handling the pandemic, before adding he's uncertain that the British leaders themselves know the answer to that question.

“Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy?” he asked. “I don't know, but more importantly, do they know?”

The scientist was particularly critical of Boris Johnson's administration for abandoning mass testing at an early stage of the outbreak, which meant that hospitals became “potentially unsafe spaces” as many asymptomatic staff and patients would have been infectious without knowing it. He did, however, praise frontline workers, comparing their bravery to that of “lions”.

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis responded to Nurse's criticism in the same radio show, arguing that the government has been “very transparent” with people and insisting that they've been following “the best scientific advice out there” about tackling coronavirus.

PM Johnson has been heavily criticized by scientists and the opposition since the start of the pandemic for drastic PPE shortages across the NHS, as well as a lack of mass testing during the early stages, although the government maintains that it acted assuming a probable worst case scenario.

Speaking to the Northern Ireland Assembly's Committee for Health, Robin Swann said that, since NI is part of the UK, residents will have access to the NHS app “whether we want it or not.”

He did not suggest downloading it, however, as a “Northern Ireland version” is being created which “can interact with” with the Republic’s one.

Northern Ireland is the only one of the UK’s devolved administrations to create its own app, since both apps on the island of Ireland will need to work in conjunction with one another. Swann said there had already been some “difficulties” and “uncertainties” with the NHS app, which is intended to alert users if they have been in contact with a person who tested positive for the virus.

Also on rt.com Contact-tracing app will be ‘key part’ of UK government’s Covid-19 ‘surveillance programme’ – Johnson spokesman

Dublin has opted for a “less intrusive” decentralized model for the app, which sees user data stored on devices rather than sent to central databases run by authorities, as is the case with the NHS app.

NI’s Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said officials from there and the Republic had met already to discuss using an all-island system. She said she had concerns around the centralized model from a “human rights point of view.”

The UK app has been beset with problems and concerns around privacy due to its centralized structure. While officials initially touted it as a “key part” of its tracing strategy, they have shifted the focus back onto manual tracing in recent days, as reports of issues with the app spread.

It also looks as though the NHS app may miss its target launch date of June 1, as it is still currently in test mode.

The young man, who has not been named, was transferred from an Ann Arbor hospital to Detroit’s Westwood Nursing Center last week after contracting the coronavirus, his father told local media. He later appeared in disturbing footage repeatedly punching an elderly man in the face. While the suspect has since been arrested for the assault, it remains unclear how or why he ended up at the nursing home in the first place, given that seniors are among the most vulnerable to the lethal illness.

“He never should have been housed – quarantined – with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,” the man’s father said, adding: “Someone dropped the ball.”

He has [mental] issues and for them to put him in a facility like that, nothing good was going to happen.

Prior to the attack that was captured on video – apparently filmed by the assailant himself – the suspect already faced charges in nearby Washtenaw County, where he is accused of assaulting a staff member at another facility. While acknowledging his son’s severe behavioral and mental problems, the father said he “never would have consented” to sending him to a nursing home had he been informed of it. It is still unknown who made the decision to transfer him there.

Some mystery also surrounds the 75-year-old victim of the nursing home assault. Relatives told local press that they began to worry when they were unable to reach him by phone, explaining that, for reasons that are still unclear, he was taken from his Detroit apartment and brought to the Westwood center. The man is now recovering from his injuries at a nearby hospital.

The incident has sparked widespread outrage, even drawing the attention of US President Donald Trump. The backlash has only been intensified with the latest revelation, prompting a flood of criticism and questions from critics online.

The ‘house arrest’ we’re all under is leaving vulnerable, mentally unwell people alone with their demons.

I start every day with a small cocktail of moderately powerful medication. Quetiapine and amitriptyline washed down with a black coffee. There’s little doubt about breakfast being the most important meal of the day for me, as it literally keeps me sane.

I have struggled with depression for at least 18 months according to my medical records, but in reality, I’m not entirely sure how long the black dog has stalked my life. Before I finally reached the point when I accepted that I needed professional help, I had all too frequent sessions with Doctors Jack Daniels and Johnny Walker. But a series of events in the latter part of 2018 and early 2019 finally made me pull the ripcord and ask for help.

It took me around a week to get an appointment with my GP in London in January of last year. The doctor was unfailingly caring and talked with me for far longer than my allotted 10 minutes, then prescribed me my first round of antidepressants (which turned out not to work). After that I was lucky: through my job, I had private health insurance and was able to get an appointment with a psychiatrist within just over a week. I’m also fortunate to have loving and caring family and friends who supported me throughout. But I am aware this is not the case for everyone, and those people are the most vulnerable.

In pre-corona times, the NHS had an upper waiting time limit of 18 weeks for consultant medical treatment. I know from my experience that had I had to wait this long for proper help, I would have been in very serious trouble. People seeking help for mental health reasons have often waited too long before they ask for it in the first place, if they even do so at all. With the added worry of Covid-19 and the inordinate amount of focus the NHS has placed on battling the virus, waiting times seem certain to rise.

Suicide is the biggest killer of men under 45 in the UK – it is a figure that never fails to shock regardless of how often it is raised. This category is broadly unlikely to suffer serious ill health if they do contract Covid-19, yet keeping them isolated is highly likely to leave them more vulnerable to damaging themselves. In the long list of “avoidable deaths,” surely the young who end their lives by their own hand should be the most avoidable of all.

‘I leaned heavily on the bottle’

Mental ailments like depression and anxiety already cause people to draw in on themselves. In my case, I became uncommunicative with my loved ones. I lived on my own at the time so hiding away was easy (but inadvisable), and I grew more and more introverted and leaned heavily on the bottle.

The evil thing about this sickness is that you need support from friends and family, but you do not feel you deserve any of it, so don’t seek it out. The social distancing and lockdown measures would have made it virtually impossible for me to get any of the support which I am absolutely convinced saved my life.

My consultations have now switched to FaceTime. They aren’t as good as the face to face sessions; conducting them in your own home over the internet still feels like an impersonal way to bare your soul. The consultation room feels like the confessional in a church, a place protected by a sacred bond of confidence. My psychiatrist is telling his patients to embrace the lockdown and to try and regard it as a time for self-reflection that we wouldn’t get in an otherwise busy world.

He told me that we should treat the feelings we get during this moment of crisis in a similar way to the sense of perspective one often gains at a funeral, but rather than letting this feeling just pass away, to try and cling onto it and learn from it when this is all over. Like I say, I was fortunate to have already been in therapy before the lockdown came in, but others were not.

The Samaritans, an organisation that provides help for those in a crisis in the UK, offers a free helpline 24/7 for anyone concerned that they may be about to harm themselves or worse. They tell me they have been as “busy as ever” during this time, answering calls from people in lockdown Britain. Having had to call on them myself once in the past, they are an invaluable service. Mental health charity Mind has also provided a wealth of information for people who may be struggling during the lockdown.

‘The old demons come knocking’

Rather strangely, the only legislative changes that have been made around mental health during the coronavirus outbreak have been to ease the restrictions around sectioning. Being sectioned is a very serious thing as it declares a person mentally incapable and allows for them to be deprived of their liberty and to be forcibly medicated.

It is for this reason that previously three people (usually two doctors and an approved mental health professional) would have to sign off before a person could be sectioned. Under provisions made under the Coronavirus Act 2020 (which passed through Parliament unopposed and with minimal scrutiny), now just one person is required to make this ruling, leaving the system more vulnerable to an abuse of power.

This is not the help that most people having a difficult time need. They need access to proper therapy, not their freedoms taken away. Likewise, friends of mine who rely on AA and NA to keep them off drink and drugs, have said that the inability to go to meetings has seen old demons knocking on their doors.

Younger people are suffering too. According to a survey conducted by employment consultancy firm ERICA, at least 55 percent of Generation Z said they were struggling with their mental health during the lockdown. All members of this group are, at their eldest, in their early 20s and for the most part at very limited risk of serious illness from Covid-19. Is it fair that we compromise the mental health of the young in favour of the physical health of the already old and unhealthy? By its overbearing actions, the UK government seems to have turned this into a needless false dichotomy.

An 18-year-old student named Betty, who, like me, suffers from clinical depression, revealed that on top of her usual mental struggles she now had the added worry of what was going to happen to her education and career prospects.

“I am very uncertain about being able to apply to university or drama schools next year,” Betty said. “My biggest concern right now about my career is that I won’t be able to get the experience that I need to be able to apply to the courses that I want.”

Betty is by no means on her own in this. The same survey showed that nearly three-quarters of young people thought their first choice of career was now at risk, and 60 percent said they would neglect their own happiness and aspirations by remaining in a job they found unsatisfying for fear they might not get another.

And then, at the other end of the spectrum, there is the psychological damage being done to the otherwise healthy old. Loneliness is well known to affect the elderly dreadfully. Old people deprived of the ability to meet friends or grandchildren potentially face the longest isolation so they can be ‘shielded’ to protect their health.

It is at best an odd society and at worst a cruel one that tells its elderly they essentially have a choice between isolation and death. Professor Sucharit Bhakdi of Mainz University in Germany is particularly concerned about the wellbeing of otherwise healthy old people. He fears that this lack of stimulation will lead them to suffer and possibly even impact their health in worse ways than the virus.

Large scale studies conducted by Brigham Young University in Utah show that by far and away the two most important factors in increasing longevity are close relationships and social integration. Our current methods make both of these factors virtually impossible.

‘I’d rather break my leg and arm’

Covid-19 has frequently been described as an “invisible enemy” by politicians during this pandemic, but mental illness is a yet more invisible illness that was threatening lives long before coronavirus ripped through the world and will continue to do so long after the virus has been brought under control.

People need real help, not stories about how ‘difficult’ Hollywood celebrities are finding being cooped up in their mansions. Aside from being ridiculous and unrelatable, this perpetuates an abhorrent misconception that depression is in some way glamourous. It isn’t glamorous and it isn’t something that makes you ‘interesting’. It is a disease that needs proper treatment.

In my time, I have broken my leg and my arm through a couple of sporting misadventures, and I can honestly say I’d break both again simultaneously if it meant never having to face depression again.

While isolation may spare people from Covid-19, there are other, far worse things that it could cause. If we are truly all in this together, then that means the mentally ill need to be cared for just as much as those hit by physical illness, not condemned to battling their thoughts alone.
