In a massive blow to hopes of finding a cure and stopping the disease in its tracks, scientists found hydroxychloroquine offered 'absolutely no benefit'.

Evidence on the medicine - subject of dozens of global trials and branded a 'game-changer' by the US President, who has admitted he is taking the drug to protect himself from catching the infection - has been mixed.

Promising results at the start of the pandemic sparked a flurry of studies, including on hospitalised patients in Britain and the US. But other trials have shown hydroxychloroquine isn't the wonder drug doctors have longed for, proving it has no effect and may have deadly side effects.

Now research of nearly 100,000 Covid-19 patients, published in prestigious medical journal The Lancet, has cast further doubt over the drug's efficacy.

As well as uncovering hydroxychloroquine had no benefit for coronavirus patients, results showed it raised the risk of death by up to 45 per cent. And Covid-19 patients taking the drug were up to five times more likely to develop a life-threatening arrhythmia - a known complication.

It comes as Oxford University researchers today announced they were looking to recruit 10,000 volunteers for the next two phases of trials of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine, considered one of the front-runners in the world's race for a jab.

Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has agreed to mass-manufacture the vaccine, in hope that millions of doses could be ready for September. The US government - which has invested $1billion (£806,00) in the project - has ordered 300million doses, while Britain has a deal for 100million.

Evidence on the medicine - subject of dozens of global trials and branded a 'game-changer' by the US President - has been mixed

WHY IS IT CONTROVERSIAL? Hydroxychloroquine - branded as Plaquenil - is a cheap drug that has been used to prevent malaria and treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis for decades. But no evidence currently exists to show the drug can prevent patients being struck down with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Scientists also warn there is no proof hydroxychloroquine, which was touted as a wonder drug by Donald Trump, can even treat COVID-19. Hope was sparked early on in the crisis when a French study suggested the drug could have both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. It triggered a flurry of research across the world, an endorsement from Trump and emergency authorization from US regulators. But other research has dealt a blow to the drug, with one Chinese trial last month finding it did not speed up the recovery of COVID-19 patients. And New York researchers last week said patients got no benefits whether they took just the drug or paired it with the antibiotic azithromycin. Leading doctors have warned the drug can cause severe side effects, and can even throw off the process that makes the heart beat in time. One trial in Brazil was stopped short because so many of the enrolled coronavirus patients given the drug developed these arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats). According to WebMD, side effects may include: Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, or headache

Slow heartbeat, symptoms of heart failure (such as shortness of breath, swelling ankles/feet, unusual tiredness, unusual/sudden weight gain)

Mental/mood changes (such as anxiety, depression, rare thoughts of suicide, hallucinations)

Hearing changes (such as ringing in the ears, hearing loss), easy bruising/bleeding

Signs of infection or liver disease

Muscle weakness, unwanted/uncontrolled movements (including tongue/face twitching), hair loss, hair/skin color changes

Low blood sugar, severe dizziness, fainting, fast/irregular heartbeat, seizures. Advertisement

Leading scientists today described the study - the latest in a string of research that has uncovered risks - as one of the 'better ones'.

Experts at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, analysed data from 96,032 hospitalised Covid-19 patients spanning six continents.

Around 5,000 of the infected were either given hydroxychloroquine or its derivative chloroquine.

Another 10,000 were given hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine alongside two other promising drugs, antibiotics azithromycin or clarithromycin.

Data from those four groups was then compared against a control sample of 81,000 Covid-19 patients, who were given other medications.

Analysis showed one in 11 patients in the control group died in hospital - at a rate of 9.3 per cent.

In comparison, 18 per cent of patients given hydroxychloroquine succumbed to the illness. The rate was 16 per cent among the chloroquine group.

When the two drugs were used in combination with one of the antibiotics, the death rate rose to almost a quarter of patients (23.8 per cent).

Researchers cautioned that some of the difference in the rates of mortality was due to underlying differences between which patients received the treatment.

Many of the sickest patients - whose risk of dying is higher - are given the drugs as a last-ditch resort.

But when other factors known to raise the risk of death were included - such as age, race, BMI and co-morbidities - the drugs still increased the risk of dying by between 34 and 45 per cent.

Lead author Dr Mandeep Mehra said: 'This is the first large scale study to find statistically robust evidence that treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients with Covid-19.

'Instead, our findings suggest it may be associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems and increased risk of death.

'Randomised clinical trials are essential to confirm any harms or benefits associated with these agents.

'In the meantime, we suggest these drugs should not be used as treatments for Covid-19 outside of clinical trials.'

Professor Stephen Evans, an expert on drugs and disease outbreaks, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the study 'interesting'.

TRUMP SAYS HE WILL FINISH HIS MALARIA PILLS WITHIN DAYS President Donald Trump has claimed he will finish his prescription for a controversial drug in a bid to prevent coronavirus in the next two days. Trump told journalists earlier this week that he had been taking the malaria pill hydroxychloroquine - which he has previously hailed as a 'gift from God' - every day to stave off coronavirius. On Tuesday the 73-year-old told reporters that: 'I think the regimen finishes in a day or two. I think it's two days.' The news the President was taking the drug came despite warnings from his own government that it should only be administered for coronavirus or in a hospital or research settings because of potentially fatal side effects. He said: 'I started taking it, because I think it’s good. I’ve heard a lot of good stories. Frontline workers take it, a lot of doctors take it, I take it. 'I'm not going to get hurt by it, it's been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus. I'm taking the two - the zinc and the hydroxyl. So far I seem to be okay.' Despite his comments, the drug has the potential to cause significant side effects in some patients and numerous studied have shown it is ineffective in combating coronavirus.

But he added: 'The main findings are definitely not good for any of these four drug treatment groups.

'It can be stated with some confidence that it is unlikely the [ongoing] randomised trials will find substantial benefit to these drugs.

'It is clear that the drugs should not be given for treatment of Covid-19 other than in the context of a randomised trial.

'It might even be said to go on giving them other than in a trial is unethical, given this evidence that is not yet contradicted by other available evidence.'

The study adds to past research that showed taking hydroxychloroquine could raise the risk of someone developing an abnormal heartbeat.

Scientists in the US and France last month found 90 per cent of critically-ill COVID-19 patients given hydroxychloroquine developed heart arrhythmias.

An arrhytmia is an abnormal heartbeat rhythm in which the heart beats too slow, too fast or irregularly.

It is relatively common, affecting around two million people per year in the UK, but can increase the risk of life-threatening events such as stroke or cardiac arrest.

Massachusetts General Hospital researchers monitored 90 patients in intensive care units, while University of Lyon academics analysed 40 patients.

Both uncovered similar results in JAMA Cardiology, after looking at the QT intervals - the time between the heart's ventricular muscles contracting and then relaxing.

When this interval becomes too long, the patient has developed a dangerous form of heart arrhythmia, called atrial fibrillation.

Responding to today's study by Brigham and Women's Hospital, Professor Babak Javid, a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals, said the drugs had 'absolutely no benefit'.

He added: 'It (the study) certainly casts a great deal of doubt whether these agents are effective in the setting in which they are currently being used.'

But Professor Javid also warned the researchers did not have data for when patients began taking the drugs.

He said: 'We know that anti-virals for Covid-19 are more likely to be effective given early in the disease process.

'Since many of the patients were severely ill, it’s possible that treatment was started fairly late.'

President Trump sparked fury earlier this week when announced he was taking the drug as a prophylaxis, despite there being no proof it works in this way.

But British researchers believe hydroxychloroquine's 'best chance' of working is if it used in prevention, which is exactly how it is used against malaria.

Up to 10,000 NHS workers will be given the drug to see if it can protect them against the coronavirus in a new international trial.

The trial will involve healthcare workers who come into direct contact with Covid-19 patients. Results are expected by the end of the year.

Hospitals in Brighton and Oxford will be among the first to be involved in the global study, which will also enroll volunteers in Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.

The TRUTH about hydroxychloroquine: Cheap malaria drug being trialled to treat COVID-19 has sparked hopes - but evidence shows it may NOT help after all and can even cause severe heart problems

INFECTED PATIENTS 'GET NO BENEFIT FROM TAKING HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE'

Researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health looked at data from 1,438 COVID-19 patients across 25 hospitals in New York.

The study, published in JAMA last month, was observational and looked at the outcomes of patients given different drug combinations.

About 25 per cent of patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin - another promising coronavirus drug - died.

In comparison, the rate was 20 per cent for those only given hydroxychloroquine alone and was 10 per cent for those on azithromycin.

90% OF CRITICAL PATIENTS GIVEN THE DRUG DEVELOPED ARRHYTHMIAS

Scientists in the US and France last month found 90 per cent of critically-ill COVID-19 patients given hydroxychloroquine developed heart arrhythmias.

An arrhytmia is an abnormal heartbeat rhythm, which could be that the heart beats too slow, too fast or irregularly.

It is relatively common, affecting around two million people per year in the UK, but can increase the risk of life-threatening events such as stroke or cardiac arrest.

Massachusetts General Hospital researchers monitored 90 patients in intensive care units, while University of Lyon academics analysed 40 patients.

Both uncovered similar results in JAMA Cardiology, after looking at the QT intervals - the time between the heart's ventricular muscles contracting and then relaxing.

When this interval becomes too long, the patient has developed a dangerous form of heart arrhythmia, called atrial fibrillation.

HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE MAY IMPAIR ABILITY OF IMMUNE SYSTEMS

Hydroxychlorouquine may impair the ability of patients' immune systems to fight off the infection, a review suggested at the start of April.

Harvard scientists analysed 10 studies as well as anecdotal reports from doctors that suggested the drug could help coronavirus patient.

The review found many of the clinical trials were poorly conducted and anecdotal reports carried little weight.

HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE DOES NOT SPEED UP RECOVERY

The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine did not speed up coronavirus patients' recovery in a trial in China, scientists revealed in April.

In a disappointing blow for the promising drug, doctors said it did not work as a cure.

Patients who were taking it suffered fewer symptoms than others who were treated alongside them without the medication but their recovery time was the same.

They had tested hydroxychloroquine on 75 COVID-19 patients in hospitals and compared their illnesses to 75 patients who didn't receive the drug.

BRAZIL TRIAL STOPPED EARLY BECAUSE OF HEART PROBLEMS

A clinical trial in Brazil had to be stopped early, it was revealed last month, because patients developed heart problems.

The Brazilian study, taking place in the Amazonian city of Manaus, had planned to enroll 440 severely ill COVID-19 patients to test two doses of chloroquine.

But researchers reported their results and called a halt to the experiment after only 81 people had received the high-dose treatment which gave them 1,200mg per day.

One in four of the patients had developed heart rhythm problems and early data suggested death rates were higher among those patients.

MALARIA DRUG DOES IMPROVE SURVIVAL ODDS, PHYSICIANS CLAIM

Hydroxychloroquine has improved the survival and recovery odds for about 90 per cent of patients treated, a physicians group claimed.

The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) presented data on 2,333 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine.

Results showed 91.6 per cent of those who got the controversial drug fared better after treatment, it was reported at the end of April.

COMBINING DRUG WITH DIET SUPPLEMENT COULD WORK BETTER

Combining hydroxychloroquine with the dietary supplement zinc could create a more effective treatment for coronavirus patients, a study suggested last week.

Researchers found taking the drugs together, along with the antibiotic azithromycin, increased patient's chances of being discharged and decreased their risk of dying.

It did not, however, change the average time patients spent in hospital, how long they spent on a ventilator or the total amount of oxygen required.

The team, from New York University Grossman School of Medicine, says the findings are encouraging but that more studies are needed.

HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE COULD HELP TREAT PATIENTS, STUDY SAYS

French researchers last month found hydroxychloroquine could treat coronavirus patients, sparking hope of a cure.

Thirty patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine for 10 days, combined with azithromycin, an antibiotic.

Although very small, the study 'showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage' after the six days.

And results showed patients had a 'much lower average carrying duration' compared to patients who received other treatments.

Several weeks later, the study's publisher said the paper 'did not meet its standards' because it excluded data on patients who did not respond well to the treatment.",15,Low,Right

Cities such as Dallas and Miami could see COVID-19 infections surge to about 700 cases per day.

And Houston, the fourth-most populated city in the US, could see daily cases surge to more than 2,000 per day.

The model, from the PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, uses cellphone data to track changes in mobility to predict the trajectory of new infections over the next four weeks.

Hotspots were predicted in at least six US states: Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas.

'As communities reopen, we're starting to detect evidence of resurgence in cases in places that have overreached a bit,' Dr David Rubin, a pediatrician and director of CHOP's PolicyLab, told The Washington Post.

It comes as all 50 states at least partially reopened this week by relaxing restrictions on businesses and social distancing in varying degrees across the country.

A new model from PolicyLab predicts that as southern and Midwest states loosen restrictions, their daily new cases will rise over the next four weeks making them the new US coroanvirus hotpsots

The biggest spike was seen in Houston, with cases in Harris County surging to 2,247 by June 16 compared to the 205 daily cases recored on May 14

In Miami, daily cases could spike to 746 by June 16, the model shows. The most recent data from May 14 showed that daily infections were down to 274

The model showed that, in Palm Beach, daily infections could reach 350 per day, a 243 percent jump from the 102 new cases recorded on May 14

For the model, the team looked at 389 counties across the country with active outbreaks, in which 68 percent of the US population resides.

They looked at daily case counts by county, which were obtained from The New York Times and USAFACTS, and used Unacast cellphone data to track mobility changes.

Next, they estimated forecasts of how daily cases would increase or decrease over a four-week period.

Researchers found that cases with early reopening plans were more prone to resurgences over the next four weeks.

For example, in Miami, daily cases could spike to 746 by June 16, the model shows. The most recent data from May 14 showed that daily infections were down to 274.

And in Palm Beach, daily infections could reach 350 per day, a 243 percent jump from the 102 new cases recorded on May 14.

Florida, which has more than 49,000 infections and more than 2,100 deaths, has lifted restrictions by allowing retail stores, restaurants, gyms and personal care services to reopen at limited capacity.

Sporting venues can also reopen without spectators but bars, nightclubs and cinemas remain closed.

The model also showed grim projections for Harris County, Texas, where the city of Houston is located.

The county recorded 205 new cases on May 14, but researchers predict infections could potentially surge to 2,247 by June 16.

In Dallas, the team estimates that cases could reach 715 per day by June 14 after just 243 were recored on May 14

The model predicts that new daily infections in Montgomery, Alabama could surge to 201 by June 16 from about 48 per day recorded on May 15.

Meanwhile, cases in Atlanta, Georgia could start increasing and hit 59 on June 16. Infections in the city, which is in Fulton County, have been rising and dropping sporadically since March. The state, which was the first to aggressively start reopening, has recorded more than 41,000 infections and over 1,700 deaths

And, in Dallas, the team estimates that cases could reach 715 per day by June 14 after just 243 were recored on May 14.

Texas, which currently has more than 52,000 cases and more than 1,400 deaths, has allowed retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters and malls to reopen at 25 percent capacity.

In some parts of the state, the establishments can open at 50 percent capacity.

'We're...seeing in our models that some areas - particularly in the south - that have moved more quickly to reopen are showing a higher risk for resurgence,' the team wrote.

'If people in Houston and Palm Beach, Florida, for example, aren't being cautious with masking in indoor crowded locations and with hygiene and disinfection, local governments may need to intervene again should they lose control of the epidemic.'

In Alabama, which has more than 13,000 infections and more than 530 deaths, gyms and personal care services have been able to reopen. Restaurants can also reopen with limited seating.

The model predicts that new daily infections in Montgomery could increase to 201 by June 16.

Currently, daily cases have been slowly increasing in the city with the count at 48 as of May 15.

In Tulsa, Oklahoma, cases are not expected to spike, but at least double from about 10 per day to 20 perday.

Meanwhile, cases in Atlanta, Georgia, could start increasing and hit 59 on June 16.

Infections in the city, which is in Fulton County, have been rising and dropping sporadically since March.

The state, which was the first to aggressively start reopening, has recorded more than 41,000 infections and over 1,700 deaths.

Gyms, personal care and restaurants have been allowed to reopen in the state.

Georgia Gov Brian Kemp has been accused of caring more about saving businesses than saving lives, a charge he dismissed as 'ridiculous.'

The Midwest is also at risk of a resurgence. The Washington Post saw caseloads spike in Crawford, Iowa and Colfax, Nebraska.

The newspaper reports that Crawford County saw cases increase by 750 percent, and in Colfax County by 1,390 percent.

'Given these cautious actions by our governments, we have already seen that the predicted resurgence in most places that are beginning to reopen - rather, daily cases are either plateauing or falling,' the CHOP researchers said.

'But the picture our models are painting for Texas and Florida provide ample evidence to others who would choose to move too quickly. We see these concerns even as we adjust for additional testing capacity that might have inflated our forecasts.'",15,Low,Right

Antibody production seen in the patients is a good sign that the vaccine may protect them from infection, but it's too soon to say for sure.

The Chinese vaccine, made by CanSino, was the very first shot to enter clinical trials earlier this year - months ahead of human testing for the UK's lead candidate jab - made by Oxford University - or the American top-contender, made by biotech Moderna.

Most of the people dosed with the vaccine had immune responses, although their levels of antibodies thought to neutralize the virus were relatively low. Researchers saw a stronger ramp-up of other immune compounds, called T-cells, that might also help fight the infection off.

There were side effects - primarily pain, muscle aches and fever - but they subsided within 28 days, and no serious or dangerous side effects were reported.

Promising results from the completed first human trial China's Ad5 coronavirus vaccine place it at the front of the global race for a shot, though only by a slim margin, an expert told DailyMail.com.

It's not yet clear whether the shot - if it proves effective - will be available in the US, and the Department of Health and Human Services had not responded to request for comment at the time of publication.

Chinese researchers have become the first to complete a human trial for a coronavirus vaccine, which was safe and triggered an immune response in participants, but a US expert worries the shot didn't produce enough 'neutralizing' antibodies to block infection (file)

The study, conducted by collaborating universities and local CDC's in China, recruited 108 patients ranging in age from 18 to 60, and split them into three groups the received, respectively, low, middle and high doses of the vaccine

At the study's start, none of the patients - who had never been infected with coronavirus - had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Within two weeks, participants in all three dosage groups had 'rapid binding antibody responses,' meaning they showed signs that they were making antibodies capable of fighting coronavirus infection.

Levels of neutralizing antibodies - a type of immune cell that binds to a virus and may be able to completely block infection - were closely monitored too.

By the second week after vaccination, everyone had moderate increase in these important immune cells.

Participants blood levels of neutralizing antibodies reached their peak by the 28th day after they were injected.

Levels of these antibodies were more than twice as high among the participants who got the high dose shot, compared to those given the low dose.

While any increase in neutralizing antibodies was a significant gain over the subjects' starting levels (zero), Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, was unimpressed with the levels produced in the trial participants.

'The one thing not we're not seeing is a really high neutralizing antibody titer,' he told DailyMail.com.

'The question is whether we’re going to need that and whether these vaccines will be adequate to stimulate an immune response.'

Patients in the trial did have more robust increases in their levels of T cells, immune cells that perform a search and destroy function, rather than the blocking work done by neutralizing antibodies.

More studies will be needed to determine whether the vaccine can protect against infection in practice.

Encouragingly, none of the 108 patients had serious side effects.

More than 80 percent did have some side effects, but these were mostly mild or moderate, like muscle aches, fever and pain. Most subsided within a couple of weeks, and almost all resolved by the end of the study.

Five patients given the high dose had high-grade fevers, but these, too, broke and came down within a couple of days.

Moderna is working closely with the NIH to develop its vaccine, and is leading the US race

The US government has placed an order for 300 million doses of AstraZeneca's shot, developed with Oxford University

'That's pretty good,' Dr Hotez says.

Side effect profiles may be particularly important to getting people to get vaccinated against coronavirus once one is available.

A Reuters poll published Thursday found that a quarter of Americans were not very or not at all interested in getting a vaccine for the virus that has infected more than 1.6 million people in the US.

Many of them said they were concerned the vaccine would be riskier than the disease itself because development is moving so fast.

So far, the US government is supporting the development of 14 candidate vaccinations through its Operation Speed initiative.

It's unclear if the US is coordinating with the Chinese vaccine developers.

In the US and UK, vaccines from Moderna and Oxford University (collaborating with AstaZeneca) are in human trials, and have shown promising early results.

China's completed trial puts it ahead - but not by much, says Dr Hotez. He says that all of the vaccines will need to go through large, Phase III trials before they become available, bringing their timelines close together.",15,Low,Right

The female worker, who had been with Amazon since November 2018, worked at the company's packing plant in North Randall, 11 miles outside of Cleveland, reported NBC News.

Spokesperson Lisa Levandowksi said the woman, who has not been identified, was last on the job on April 30, the same day she was diagnosed.

However, the company only learned of her test results on May 8, and she died on May 18.

The company has refused to release complete data on the number of employees who have been infected, died or recovered from coronavirus.

The female employee worked in packing at an Amazon fulfillment center in North Randall, Ohio, just outside of Cleveland. She was diagnosed on April 30 and died on May 18

'We are saddened by the loss of an associate who had worked at our site in Randall, Ohio,' Levandowski told NBC News.

'Her family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting her fellow colleagues.'

At least seven other Amazon warehouse workers have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

NBC News reports that those deaths have taken place in Hawthorne, California; Tracy, California; Waukegan, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; Jeffersonville, Indiana; Bethpage, New York; and Staten Island, New York.

Levandowski said Amazon is providing grief counseling to the woman's colleagues and utilizing contact tracing.

At least 13 state attorneys have asked for Amazon to provide data on the actual number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

However, Amazon has refused to release any figures regarding the number of employees affected by the disease -but says it is improving the safety of its workers.

This includes providing face masks and temperature checks and disinfecting surfaces such as elevators buttons and door handles.

'We respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so,' Amazon said in a statement last month,

'However, these rights do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, well-being or safety of their colleagues.'

Hourly pay has also been increased for its workers by $2 per hour and those that are diagnosed with the disease will receive paid sick leave.

Amazon has seen an increase in its service with more people quarantined at home and needing deliveries, and this good news for the company's CEO Jeff Bezos.

A recent report from Comparisun, which compares popular small business services and products, predicted that Bezos will become the world's first trillionaire, a status he may reach by 2026 at age 62.

Answering press questions during a tour of the Ford factory in Michigan, Trump said 'we are not closing our country' when asked whether another peak of the virus at the end of the year could force the US in to a second lockdown.

'People say that's [a second wave] a very distinct possibility, it's standard,' Trump said.

'We are going to put out the fires. We're not going to close the country.'

'We can put out the fires. Whether it is an ember or a flame, we are going to put it out. But we are not closing our country,' he added.

Trump's comments came during a tour of the Ford factory in Ypsilanti, which is producing ventilator parts. He didn't wear a face mask despite it being a state requirement.

The nature of the second wave likely to hit the US has been disputed by leading experts, with some predicting another peak in fall and winter - flu season - while others predict a series of acute eruptions of the virus in communities throughout the country which will be impossible to predict.

In an email to the New York Times, Dr Anthony Fauci said his main intention was to get across 'the danger of trying to open the country prematurely.'

Dr. Anthony Fauci, pictured in March, has warned against states opening too quickly, fearing they could spark a second wave of infections

Dr Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, fears 'the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country' if states 'skip over' their reopening guidelines.

'This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal,' he said.

As the virus started to spread through the US, Trump avoided shutting down the country, leaving individual states to make the decision.

In April the president claimed to have 'absolute power' to compel governors to rescind their stay-home orders amid the coronavirus outbreak, but soon retreated on the statement.

Trump has pushed for states to reopen as part of his effort to jump start the troubled economy and against the advice of health experts.

All 50 US states have started the phased reopening process. Today, Alaska announced it would be skipping over phases three and four and scrapping lockdown, with businesses allowed to operate at 100 per cent capacity.

Protesters demonstrate during a rally against Pennsylvania's coronavirus stay-at-home order at the state Capitol in Harrisburg, Pa., Friday, May 15, 2020. Trump blasted Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania during his visit to a factory in Allentown last week, pushing for the crucial state in his reelection campaign to reopen

Despite his assurance that the US will not be locked down again, Trump would be unable to intervene if a state decided to do so.

The president has been critical of those states who are slow to open, accusing some Democratic governors of playing politics.

Trump has based his 2020 reelection bid on a strong economy and wants businesses to reopen their doors after being shuttered by the virus, which has infected more than 1.6 million Americans and killed over 90,000. Among the economic effects, 36 million people have lost jobs as unemployment hit levels that haven't been seen since the Great Depression.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania felt the president's wrath last week.

Trump blasted Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania during his visit to a factory in Allentown, Pennsylvania, last week.

'You have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit. There are areas of Pennsylvania barely effected and they want to keep them closed. You can't do that,' he said.

The president has pushed for Pennsylvania - a state crucial to his re-election - to reopen.

'The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails,' he wrote on Twitter on Monday.

Wolf, in return, called those pushing to restart the economy 'selfish and unsafe.'",15,Low,Right

Flags flew at half-staff at the White House, the Capitol and the National Mall to mark the start of three days of commemoration of the victims of coronavirus Friday.

The flags came down after Donald Trump ordered the lowering as the death count passed 95,000, with the likelihood it will hit 100,000 early next week.

He had come under political pressure to mark the deaths from Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who demanded the move.

On a dreary day in the capital, there were only a few passers-by to see the lowered flags; the city remains one of the nation's hotspots and is not going to start reopening until at least next week.

Trump had tweeted on Thursday evening: 'I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to half-staff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus.'

The president also announced for flags to fly at half-staff on federal buildings and national monuments to commemorate military personnel who have died.

'On Monday, the flags will be at half-staff in honor of the men and women in our Military who have made the Ultimate Sacrifice for our Nation.'

Lowered: The flag over the White House was lowered to half-staff early on Friday and will remain there all weekend, first for the victims of coronavirus, then for Memorial Day

Remembered: As the death toll passed 95,000 and headed towards 100,000, flags were lowered on federal buildings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in memory of the victims of the virus

View from the north: The lowered White House flag could be see from Lafayette Park

Lowered on the Capitol: The flag to the east portico of the Capitol was lowered Friday morning in line with demands from Speaker Nancy Pelosi

Honor the lost: The deserted Capitol, where the Senate and House are on recess over Memorial Day, had its flags lowered for the first time

Sign of sorrow: The Capitol was one of the federal buildings where flags were lowered in recognition of those who died from coronavirus

Rare jogger: The normally packed National Mall's memorials have all lowered their flags in line with orders from President Donald Trump, including these at the Washington Monument

Mourning in America: Three days of official mourning for the dead of the pandemic started Friday with flags including those at the Washington Monument lowered

Masks: The Washington Monument, where flags were lowered, was virtually deserted Friday, with two e-scooter riders, masks at the ready, passing it

Time to reflect: The Capitol, seen in a puddle of water, was among federal buildings to lower flags

Memorial weekend: Friday, Saturday and Sunday are days of commemoration for the more than 95,000 dead of the pandemic, and Monday is Memorial Day

Half-staff: One of the flags at the Washington Monument is seen lowered

On Thursday, House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer had written to Trump saying that the tribute would serve as a 'national expression of grief so needed by everyone.'

'Our hearts are broken over this great loss and our prayers are with their families,' Pelosi and Schumer wrote.

'Respectful of them and the loss to our country, we are writing to request that you order flags to be flown at half staff on all public buildings in our country on the sad day of reckoning when we reach 100,000 deaths.'

Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, made the same suggestion several weeks ago.

The president has the right to order that flags be flown at half-staff for tragic events and the deaths of notable officials.

The United States has averaged nearly 1,300 coronavirus deaths per day this week.

In New York, flags have been lowered for more than a month in recognition of its status as the worst-affected city and state.

The Downing Street aide is claimed to have travelled from London to his parents' home in Durham in March - after the travel ban came into force.

Offers ticked him off and stressed the need to follow the restrictions after 'shocked' neighbours spotted him in the North East.

Mr Cummings was fighting his own coronavirus battle around the time he made the 250-mile journey.

His wife, the journalist Mary Wakefield, has written about his struggle with the disease and suggested he was holed up at their London residence.

The Prime Minister's spokesperson at the time also said he was isolating 'at home'.

But a Mirror and Guardian investigation has claimed that the 48-year-old Brexiteer was ticked off by Durham constabulary.

Durham Constabulary did not confirm an identity, but said they had spoken to an individual who had travelled from London after being tipped off on March 31.

Boris Johnson 's chief adviser Dominic Cummings was investigated by the police for flouting lockdown rules, it was revealed tonigh

A spokesman for the force said: 'Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the individual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.'

Mr Cummings was not slapped with the £60 fine for breaching the rules, but officers stressed the need to follow the lockdown - which he played a part in initiating.

Following the Prime Minister's landmark address to the nation on March 23, emergency laws were ushered in to tighten travel restrictions.

The rules, which came into force on March 26, stated: 'You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.

'The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off.'

The day after these curbs were enforced, Mr Cummings raised eyebrows when he was pictured sprinting along Downing Street.

On March 30, news broke that the aide was self-isolating with Covid-19 symptoms, and the PM's spokesperson later confirmed he was 'at home'.

But the next day, Durham Police caught wind of his breach of the rules and stressed the need for him to follow the guidance.

This was followed by sightings from neighbours, including on April 5 when the maverick Brexiteer was seen in his parents Robert and Morag's back garden, where he was blasting out Dancing Queen by Abba.

On April 23, the aide was pictured back in the capital arriving at the back of Westminster.

Downing Street tonight declined to comment, but it the revelations were quickly seized upon by political rivals.

Labour has demanded Number 10 offers up a 'very swift explanation' for Mr Cummings' actions.

A party spokesman said: 'If accurate, the Prime Minister's chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules.

'The Government's guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel.

'The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings. Number 10 needs to provide a very swift explanation for his actions.'",15,Low,Right

Matt appeared to be by himself on the outing, with his wife Luciana and their children Isabella, 13, Gia, 11, and Stella, nine, likely remaining in the luxurious mansion the family are renting during lockdown.

It comes after Matt recently spoke to Graham O’Toole and Nathan O’Reilly on Ireland's Spin 103.8’s Fully Charged, where he admitted COVID-19 'is scary' and spoke of Alexia, who is his wife Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship.

'For Lucy’s mum and my mum, it’s scary for that generation. I think we’ve all got the message now, everyone’s doing the isolation and social distancing and hand-washing and everything we can to mitigate this but it’s frightening, certainly for our parents.’

It seems Dalkey has gained the A-list stamp of approval, as Matt gushed: 'It’s incredible. This is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been. It feels a little like a fairytale here. Bono lives over there, Enya lives over there’.

Before lockdown began in Ireland on March 27, the Oscar winner was snapped posing outside a cafe and in a restaurant with fans, as well as going swimming near Dalkey with his clothes in a bag from Irish grocery store SuperValu.

Another wrote: 'Matt Damon (huge fan) in Dalkey with a Supervalue bag made my day. Just speaks to how human we all are. This virus has no selectivity, does not discriminate and affects us all over the world. I hope Matt is enjoying his stay here.'

The tickled star weighed in on rumours that he was carrying beers in the SuperValu bag when he was snapped by a fan.

He said: 'That bag, we just had a the towels. I was with the kids, we were taking a dip there. We didn’t show up with beach bags, we were just improvising...

'I’m sure there were cans in there originally, we just had to take them out to put the beach towels in.’

The star, worth an estimated $160million, has also reportedly been seen jogging around Dalkey. Matt visited the Corner Note Cafe with his family on March 15 and happily posed for a photo with waitress Mary Caviston.

She told the Irish Mail On Sunday she was 'surprised' when she realised the man at table 92 was the Hollywood icon. She said: 'He came in at about 9.30 on a Sunday morning. It was 15 March so just two days before we went into lockdown.

'He was with his wife and his beautiful children, there were six of them in total, he was the last in and he was wearing a baseball cap, and I did catch the American accent but other than that he was just like any other customer.

The Monarch, 94, is relying heavily on her religion to 'sustain her' throughout the global pandemic but is struggling to adapt to a new way of worship, the source told People magazine.

Her Majesty is currently residing at Windsor Castle with her husband Prince Philip, but misses the 'community feel' of going to church with friends and family.

The source said: 'Her Christian faith means so much to her, and those rituals of going to church on Sunday and praying in chapel are not happening.'

The Queen (pictured during her Easter address to the nation last month) has been using her 'simple and solid' faith to get through the coronavirus crisis, a source has claimed

The monarch is replying heavily on her religion to 'sustain her' throughout the global pandemic (she is pictured at Westminster Abbey, London, on Commonwealth Day earlier this year)

Buckingham Palace will be closed for the summer for what is believed to be the first time in 27 years, with events including Trooping the Colour and Her Majesty's garden parties cancelled.

It is believed to be the 94-year-old monarch's longest absence from her official duties in her 68 year reign, with her schedule not expected to resume until into the autumn at the earliest.

However despite missing the community spirit around her, the Queen is finding solace in walking her beloved dogs and riding her horses.

A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said earlier this month she continues to be 'busy', conducting a weekly audience with the Prime Minister by phone and receiving her daily red boxes of Government papers.

Her Majesty is currently residing at Windsor Castle with her husband Prince Philip, but misses the 'community feel' of going to church with friends and family (She is pictured at the St. Peter & St. Paul Church Sunday morning service in West Newton earlier this year)

They added that Her Majesty will 'follow appropriate advice on engagements' and is keeping in touch with her family by phone and video calls.

Most members of the royal family belong to belong to the Church of England and regularly attend Christmas services at St. Mary Magdalene at Sandringham Estate.

The Queen, supreme governor of the Church of England, is well known for her faith, which she has spoken about in broadcasts and speeches.

Last month, the royal called for 'light and life' to overcome despair, as she declared that Easter is 'not cancelled' in a special message Bank Holiday message.

Delivering her first Easter audio address, she said: 'As dark as death can be - particularly for those suffering with grief - light and life are greater. May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.'

Her pre-recorded speech offered support to those marking Easter privately and the wider country, and she said: 'But Easter isn't cancelled; indeed, we need Easter as much as ever.'

It ended on a positive note: 'May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.'

Her Majesty has delivered what is believed to be her first Easter address, which had the resolute message: 'We know that coronavirus will not overcome us'. Pictured: A grab from the video posted on the Royal Family's social media page

In 2016, Her Majesty wrote in The Bible Society of her enduring Christian faith as she shared a treasured memory of the moment George VI prayed for the nation during the Second World War.

In the foreword to The Servant Queen And The King She Serves, she wrote about a poem used by her father in 1939 called 'The Gate Of The Year'.

She went on to write: ‘I have been – and remain – very grateful to you for your prayers and to God for His steadfast love. I have indeed seen His faithfulness.’",15,Low,Right

He said that to their advantage, 'New Zealand seems to have been very effective in controlling the virus and their goal is not mitigation, but eradication, which they believe that they can do with aggressive contact tracing and testing.'

Cameron said that even with the missed time, progress was still made on the film with some crew members able to work from home on digital effects.

'We've got everybody – everybody at Weta Digital and Lightstorm – working from home to the extent that that is possible,' he said. 'There's a very good chance that our shoot might be delayed a couple of months, but we can still do it. So that's good news.'

He said that he was hampered attempting to do his job in the director's chair in working in line with the restrictions.

'My work is on the stage doing the virtual cameras and so on, so I can do a bit of editing, but it's not great for me.'

'Instead of asking his brother, @NYGovCuomo why he decided to pack COVID patients into nursing homes, killing untold amounts of people, @ChrisCuomo pulled out oversized, prop cotton swabs to mock how big his brother's nose was. This is the state of ""journalism"" on @CNN. Pathetic!'

However, some Twitter users came to the Cuomos' defense noting that Gov. Cuomo holds a press conference every day on the coronavirus crisis and numbers in hard-hit New York.

Some Twitter users defended the brothers saying: 'There’s nothing wrong with a little bit of comedy relief. Lighten up'

'So, these two take the 90K dead very seriously as do the rest of us. They also know that they (and we) also have to have a laugh because otherwise this country will end up in a state of depression. There’s nothing wrong with a little bit of comedy relief. Lighten up,' one Twitter user said.

'First of all, is it true that when you are having the test administered, you inhaled and the doctor's finger went all the way up your nose and got stuck and had to be released with a tool?' Chris asked with a straight face.

The governor couldn’t help but crack a smile and said, 'No, actually she wanted to comment that I have a little button nose and she was afraid the swab would actually hurt because it extended my nasal cavity.'

Chris Cuomo jokingly procured several massive nasal swabs joking that the governor's nose required a much bigger swab

On Sunday the governor received a coronavirus nasal swab test on live TV to calm the public over concerns that the test is painful

Then he pulled out a mock cotton swab the size of a baseball bat.

'So then, in scale, this was the actual swab that was being used to fit up that double-barrel shotgun that you have mounted on the front of your pretty face?' Chris said.

'See I said I was going to be nice and sweet…Very funny,' the Governor said cracking up.

'I thought I did so well on that nasal test. Standing up there, she did the swab, I did not flinch. I was a cool dude in a loose mood,' Cuomo said.

'Of course you were! That swab was like a piece of lint going in that thing on your face. How could it have collected anything? It was like throwing a rock around a cave!' the reporter said.

'That is so not right. This is not love,' the governor said jokingly.

At the end of the show Chris tried to thank his brother for being a good sport about his jokes.

'Thank you for coming on, thank you for having a good sense of humor about what is a very important public service message. A lot of people aren't getting tested because they're worried about it. Thank you for showing people how easy it is to get tested,' he said.

'That was not -- that was beyond -- don't call me, I'll call you,' Andrew said in response.

The Countess, 55, is patron of Shooting Star Children's Hospices, a charity which cares for babies, children and young people with life-limiting conditions, and their families.

The organisation, which has also been visited by other senior royals including Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge, has been forced to close one of its sites in Hampton, south west London, reports The Mirror.

The cash crisis is a result of the mass cancellation of fundraising events such as the London Marathon, as well as the closure of high street charity shops during lockdown.

Sophie - who visited the Hampton facility in February, where she was pictured greeting its vice-president, Spandau Ballet star Tony Hadley, and icing biscuits with its residents - is said to be 'closely following their situation and being kept regularly informed', according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson.

'She was incredibly moved by a video they posted recently and she was incredibly sad to hear that they have had to close the Hampton hospice for now,' they told the publication.

'She is hugely passionate about the role they play in the children's lives and she will continue to support them where she can in the coming months.'

Karen Sugarman, vice president of SSCH, which supports children in London and Surrey, told The Mirror: 'Covid-19 has had a devastating effect, like being run over by a massive steamroller.

'Nobody could have been prepared for this. We are fighting with everything we have to be there for people who need us in their darkest hour.'

She added that the emergency £480,000 awarded to Shooting Star last month by the government 'merely papered over the cracks' as its services cost £30,000 a day.

Karen accused the government of being slow to react and not providing an adequate response to the pandemic.

'The Countess and our other supporters are with us as well and that means so much. We are in an unprecedented times and must raise money to keep the service going for children and families who rely on us,' she said.

Shooting Star House in Hampton, which has 10 child bedrooms and six family flats, will remain empty until funding is found.

The facility was opened in 2006 by Prince Charles and Camilla. The duchess then invited some of the children to help decorate their Christmas tree at Clarence House.

The Duchess of Cambridge - who is patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices - visited the charity at its former site in Middlesex in 2013.

Covid-19 has wreaked havoc across the continent and stalled swathes of the global economy with governments forced to ramp up borrowing to levels not seen in peacetime history.

Mr Soros, 89, believes perpetual bonds - bonds that cannot be redeemed but provide continuous interest payments to investors - could keep the EU afloat.

But to fund these bonds, the EU may need to directly tax the citizens of its member states.

Billionaire financier George Soros (pictured) said the European Union could be forced to directly tax its citizens as the bloc faces collapse due to the coronavirus pandemic

Covid-19 has wreaked havoc across the continent with Italy one of the worst hit countries (a Naples street being disinfected by army officials)

In a transcript of a question-and-answer session emailed to reporters, Mr Soros said the damage to the euro zone economy from the new coronavirus would last 'longer than most people think'.

He added that the rapid evolution of the virus meant that a reliable vaccine would be hard to develop.

In a transcript of a question-and-answer session emailed to reporters, Mr Soros (pictured) said the damage to the euro zone economy from the new coronavirus would last 'longer than most people think'

The hedge-fund veteran and chairman of Soros Fund Management LLC said perpetual bonds - used by the British to finance wars against Napoleon - would allow the European Union to survive.

'If the EU is unable to consider it now, it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts,' Soros said.

'This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.'

Soros, who earned fame by betting against the pound in 1992, said that with major countries such as Germany selling bonds with a negative yield, perpetual bonds would ease a looming budget crunch across the bloc.

He said the EU would have to maintain its 'AAA' credit rating to issue such debt - and thus have to have tax-raising powers to cover the cost of the bonds - so suggested it could simply authorise the taxes rather than imposing them.

'There is a solution,' said Soros. 'The taxes only have to be authorized; they don't need to be implemented.'

Asked about Brexit, Soros said he was particularly worried about Italy: 'What would be left of Europe without Italy?'

'The relaxation of state aid rules, which favour Germany, has been particularly unfair to Italy, which was already the sick man of Europe and then the hardest hit by COVID-19,' Soros said.

China is set to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong, prompting a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump. Beijing also failed to set an economic growth target as the pandemic hammers the word's second-largest economy.

Trump said on Thursday that the U.S. will 'react strongly' if China pushes ahead with the plan to crack down on Hong Kong.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude declined by $1.94, or 5.7 percent, to $31.98 at 11.50am GMT. Brent crude dropped $1.72, or 4.8 percent, to $34.34 a barrel, after falling as low as $33.54.

Pump jacks are seen operating near Loco Hills in Eddy County, New Mexico in the Permian Basin last month. Oil prices fell on Friday as expectations of global demand weakened

'Investors are once again having to contend with an intensifying war of words between the U.S. and China,' said Stephen Brennock of broker PVM.

'The coronavirus has nullified a decade of global oil demand growth and the recovery will be slow.'

Beijing's move to take over long-stalled efforts to enact national security legislation in semi-autonomous Hong Kong spooked markets following months of pro-democracy demonstrations last year that at times descended into violence between police and protesters.

The proposed bill is aimed at forbidding secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism. Such proposals are certain to be approved by the largely ceremonial parliament.

Oil has slumped in 2020, with Brent hitting a 21-year low below $16 in April and U.S. crude falling below zero. With fuel use rising and supply cuts starting, Brent has since more than doubled and was on track for a fourth weekly gain.

Pro-democracy protesters hold placards protesting new security legislation that was submitted to China's rubber-stamp on May 22

'The oil market is not out of the woods yet,' said Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank. 'We regard the latest price rally on the oil market to be excessive.'

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, are reducing supply by a record 9.7 million barrels per day from May 1 to support the market.

Export figures suggest OPEC+ made a strong start. In a sign of the glut easing, U.S. crude inventories fell last week.

Delta is set to receive $5.4 billion and JetBlue $935 million.

They said cutting employee hours is not consistent with Congress' intent under the CARES Act and potentially illegal, the lawmakers said.

United Airlines first drew fire from lawmakers after it was also considering work hour reductions and backed off the plan after it was sued by The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the union which represents the workers, the Washington Post reports

The carrier is now asking for voluntary reductions in work hours.

Warren on Tuesday pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a Senate Banking Committee to ensure companies that received the aid kept workers on the payroll.

The letters from the senators claim Delta was the first airline to cut hours for employees after receiving assistance from the CARES Act.

In writing to JetBlue chief executive Robyn Hayes, lawmakers allege that since receiving Cares Act funding the carrier slashed hours for mechanics, passenger service agents and ramp workers. In the case of both airlines, the senators point out that company officials say the 'reductions in hours comply with the CARES Act.'

SEA Holdings, through law firm Clifford Chance, argued Delaware North was liable for all losses and expenses suffered as a result of the resort's closure.

The resort was obliterated by Cyclone Yasi in 2011 and rebuilding efforts were hampered by two more cyclones in 2014 and 2015 before the $45 million rebuild opened in November 2015.

This was during the government-imposed lockdown where Queenslanders couldn't even leave their homes, let alone take luxury island holidays.

Grace Havens, 13, was hospitalised in Gloucestershire after developing a red rash, severe pain and inflamed organs.

She was later diagnosed with Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP), which has similar symptoms to Kawasaki Disease.

The childhood inflammatory syndrome is a secondary condition triggered by an initial illness and up to 100 cases reported across the country since April, amid concerns it is linked to coronavirus.

Grace Havens, 13, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, suffered from an inflammatory illness in hospital which her mother Rachel Havens, 47, believes she developed as a result of Covid-19

After initially developing symptoms on February 28, Grace was admitted to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital after developing a rash on March 5. After losing a stone in four weeks, she was fed both nasally and through total parenteral nutrition (TPN)

Her parents, event planner Rachel Havens and psychological therapist Justin Havens, 52, believe 'fun and energetic' Grace developed Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) as a result of coronavirus. They are waiting for an antibody test to confirm this

Her mother, event planner Rachel Havens, 47, believes her daughter developed HSP as a result of Covid-19.

Rachel and her husband, psychological therapist Justin Havens, 52, are waiting for an antibody test to confirm this.

The couple from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire are speaking out to spread awareness of this possible secondary illness.

The mother-of-three said: 'I personally believe Covid-19 is responsible for the severity of it.

Doctor's initially though Grace was suffering from appendicitis after she returned from school complaining of a sore stomach and temperature in February

Mother-of-three Rachel personally believes Covid-19 is responsible for the severity of Grace's illness

'It won't change anything for Grace - at the end of the day, I believe she had it, but it's not going to change anything because we are where we are.

'I think what's happening is children are getting coronavirus mildly but it's triggering this extra awful inflammatory syndrome in them.'

'Fun and energetic' Grace returned from school complaining of a sore stomach and temperature on February 28.

Following two visits to the GP, Grace was sent to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital Children's Center with suspected appendicitis.

Children with the illness are usually taken to hospital with a high fever that has lasted a number of days and severe abdominal pain. The most seriously ill may develop sepsis-like symptoms such as rapid breathing and poor blood circulation

Doctors were unable to find a cause and sent her home before she developed a rash on March 5 and was admitted to hospital for four weeks.

Grace was given morphine, fentanyl and paracetamol for the pain while doctors treated her sickness and rash.

After losing a stone in four weeks, she was fed both nasally and through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

She spent a further three weeks at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children after blood was found in her stool.

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE SYNDROME? WHAT SYMPTOMS DOES IT CAUSE? The majority of the children being hospitalised with the condition have suffered from a high fever for a number of days, severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Some develop a rash and red eyes or red lips, while a very small group go into shock, in which the heart is affected and they may get cold hands and feet and have rapid breathing. The symptoms are similar to those caused by Kawasaki disease, a rare but treatable condition that affects around eight in every 100,000 children each year in the UK. WHEN DID OFFICIALS FIRST START TO SEE CASES? The NHS sent an alert to doctors on April 27, warning them to look out for signs of the syndrome. At the time they said cases had been appearing in tiny numbers in London for about three weeks. Since then they have spread further across the country and between 75 and 100 children are known to have been infected. IS IT CAUSED BY SARS-COV-2, THE CORONAVIRUS? Doctors are almost certain the illness is being caused by the coronavirus but they haven't yet been able to prove it. Cases began appearing as the UK's coronavirus outbreak hit its peak and similar conditions have been reported in China and Italy during the pandemic. However, not all children with the Kawasaki-like syndrome test positive for the virus. Swab testing has suggested some of the children have not been infected with COVID-19 at the time they were ill. But all patients have tested positive for antibodies, doctors said, meaning they have had the coronavirus in the past. They said this suggests it is a 'post-infectious phenomenon' which is caused by a delayed overreaction of the immune system, which may happen weeks or even up to a month after the child was infected with COVID-19. IS IT TREATABLE? Yes. All but one of the children who have been diagnosed with the syndrome have survived. The only child known to have died with it, a 14-year-old boy, died of a stroke that was triggered by the life support machine he was on. Doctors are currently treating the condition by using medications to calm down the immune system and dampen the overreaction. Dr Liz Whittaker, a paediatrician at Imperial College Healthcare in London, said the sickest children are usually very ill for four to five days and begin to recover a couple of days after starting treatment.

Since, she's developed a chronic kidney condition called Crescentic Nephritis - her kidneys are continuing to leak high levels of protein and remain inflamed.

Rachel said: 'We are extremely grateful to the NHS for the fact that our daughter is now safe and recovering well at home.

'While we are told the majority of children will be unharmed by Covid-19, there appear to be a number who are randomly but severely affected.

'This is why I felt we should share our daughter's story, with the aim of raising awareness in the hope that as science progresses, less lives will be affected.'

Up to 100 children in the UK are known to have developed a rare inflammatory syndrome caused by COVID-19 since the beginning of April.

All the children treated for this inflammatory disease so far had been healthy before they caught the coronavirus, according to Dr Liz Whittaker.

Dr Whittaker is a paediatrician at Imperial College Healthcare in London and has herself treated children with the illness, which has been likened to Kawasaki disease.

She said they are not showing signs of 'typical' Covid-19 infection and it was not obvious why some children were worse affected than others.

Dr Whittaker said: 'To date, the children have not had underlying comorbidities [illnesses] that we have identified.

'We are gathering that information through a surveillance study that [is] happening both in the UK and internationally, but so far there isn't anything in particular that we can comment on from that perspective.'

Scientists do not fully understand how the virus affects young people and fewer than 500 children have been hospitalised because of it in Britain since the outbreak began, according to one top paediatrician.

That compares to tens of thousands of adults, many of whom have died - 12 people under the age of 20 have died with Covid-19 in England so far, out of a total of 23,953.

However, doctors revealed last week that dozens of children, most aged between five and 15 years old, have become seriously ill with the condition that seems to appear up to a month after catching the coronavirus.

They say it is extremely rare and does not appear to have directly killed anyone in Britain but can lead to intensive care for a small proportion of those who get it.

At least 18 children in London have been diagnosed with it since doctors first started noticing the syndrome last month.

Most troubling for experts is that the illness is almost definitely caused by Covid-19 in some way but scientists can't prove it.

The young patients' lungs are not affected by it, unlike in adults where the coronavirus's main target is the lungs, and many test negative when they are swabbed for the disease.

All of the patients studied so far, however, have tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, meaning they have been exposed to the virus in the past.

Scientists now believe it could be the consequence of the immune system overreacting after it has fought off the coronavirus infection, causing a second illness weeks later.

The same illness has been seen in Italy and China and around 100 children are known to have been diagnosed with it in New York.",15,Low,Right

In a video posted on Instagram on Friday, the former My Kitchen Rules judge said it was 'important' that his followers engage with Eisenstein's latest article.

In the lengthy blog titled The Conspiracy Myth, Eisenstein addressed some of the theories surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.

It's important to remember, however, that there is no factual basis for any of the coronavirus conspiracy theories being circulated online.

Eisenstein claimed the conspiracy theories about COVID-19 were being 'fuelled by the authoritarian response to the pandemic'.

He said many people believe - incorrectly - that 'an evil, power-hungry cabal of insiders deliberately created the pandemic, or is at least ruthlessly exploiting it, to frighten the public into accepting a totalitarian world government under permanent medical martial law, a New World Order'.

Pete, 47, said Eisenstein's opinions closely mirrored his own - that is, he believes the government's response to coronavirus has stoked paranoia.

Pete told his followers: 'Have a read of this beautiful man's words. He always has such a wondrous way of illustrating and communicating his thoughts, and they echo mine, but he says it so much more beautifully.'

In another Instagram post on Friday, Pete shared a screenshot of Eisenstein's essay and urged his supporters to read it.

'IMPORTANT. Please read the whole essay from start to finish whether you believe in conspiracy myths or staunchly oppose them,' he wrote.

'This is powerful and beautiful. Thank you @charles_eisenstein once again for voicing my own thoughts in a much more succinct and wonderful way and even allowing the space for me to open up even more and question my own beliefs.'

In his essay, Eisenstein claimed the coronavirus pandemic had enabled powerful forces to gain more control in society.

'The solution template is, facing any problem, to find something to control - to quarantine, to track, to imprison, to wall out, to dominate, or to kill,' he wrote.

Australia's chief doctor blasts COVID-19 conspiracy theorists Earlier this month, Australia's top doctor slammed 'nonsense' conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to coronavirus, claiming there's 'absolutely no evidence' to support the outrageous claims. Those who believe ultra-fast mobile technology causes the deadly virus were among hundreds of protesters who rallied and clashed with police outside Parliament House in Melbourne on May 10. Australian chief medical doctor Professor Brendan Murphy said the protest was the result of 'a lot of very silly misinformation'. 'There is absolutely no evidence about 5G doing anything in the coronavirus space,' Prof Murphy said in Canberra on Sunday. 'I have unfortunately received a lot of communication from these conspiracy theorists myself. It is complete nonsense. 5G has got nothing at all to do with coronavirus. 'Similarly, I understand people have the right to protest, but they should not be breaching those social distancing rules and if they are, they should be held to account.' Interest in ridiculous theories that the ultra-fast mobile technology causes coronavirus have swept across the globe during the pandemic, despite experts debunking the claims. Advertisement

Heavy reading: In another Instagram post on Friday, Pete shared a screenshot of Eisenstein's essay and urged his supporters to read it

'If control fails, more control will fix it. To achieve social and material paradise, control everything, track every movement, monitor every word, record every transaction.

'Then there can be no more crime, no more infection, no more disinformation... This is not a conspiracy, though it can certainly look like one.'

Eisenstein also claimed that anyone who questioned 'mainstream beliefs' was being labelled a conspiracy theorist.

The three-day Eid al-Fitr celebrations begin on May 23, marking the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan for 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide.

But this year the usual lavish celebrations of huge family parties and meals will be largely banned as authorities seek to prevent new outbreaks of the killer coronavirus.

Some countries, including Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, will impose round-the-clock curfews for the duration of the holiday.

In Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the largest Arab gulf country, people will only be allowed to leave their homes to buy food and medicine.

Pictures from earlier this month showed the central courtyard of the Great Mosque of Mecca deserted as Muslims were forced to celebrate Ramadan in isolation amid the unprecedented lockdown measures.

The courtyard is usually at its busiest during Hajj but remains open all year round for other pilgrimages meaning it is almost never empty.

Other Middle Eastern countries have faced criticism over their lockdown measures.

Authorities in Iran, which has endured the deadliest outbreak in the Middle East, have imposed few restrictions ahead of the holiday aside from cancelling mass prayers in Tehran traditionally led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Iran has faced a backlash for not imposing the kind of lockdown seen elsewhere in the region, but authorities say they had to concede the effects on an economy gutted by US sanctions.

Iran has reported nearly 130,000 cases and more than 7,000 deaths, but the rate of new infections has declined in recent weeks.

The widespread restrictions come as medics in Yemen warn of an unfolding 'coronavirus catastrophe', France24 reported.

Many of those infected in the war-torn country never even make it to hospital, the charity Doctors Without Borders warned.

And the World Health Organisation has said that in the worst-case scenario, half of Yemen's 30million-strong population could be infected with the virus and more than 40,000 could die.

In Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country with a population of 270million, President Joko Widodo said restrictions would remain in place through the holiday.

The country has a population of 270 million people and has seen more than 18,000 cases, including around 1,200 deaths.

'I emphasise, there is no relaxing the policy of large-scale social restriction yet,' Mr Widodo said during a virtual Cabinet meeting this week.

Since the start of the Ramadan, the government has imposed an outright ban on 'mudik', a holiday tradition in which millions of Indonesians living in big cities flock to their hometowns to celebrate with relatives.

Health experts had warned it could set off a wave of new cases.

'This ongoing pandemic has changed our tradition, separated us in celebrating Eid,' said Noor Hidayat Asri, a civil servant in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.

'We are like dealing with a merciless and invisible enemy this time around.'

Among other countries, Malaysia will allow people to visit relatives who live nearby but gatherings are limited to 20 people.

Visitors are urged to wear face masks and to refrain from hugging, kissing and sharing plates.

While some mosques have reopened, congregations remain limited to 30 people.

India's 172 million Muslims are also preparing for a subdued holiday, with large gatherings banned.

They have faced heightened stigma, threats and boycotts by many Hindus, who blame the local outbreak on a three-day convention of Islamic missionaries held in March.

In some states, Indian Muslims have launched campaigns urging people to refrain from buying new clothes for the holiday and instead give to the needy.

In Iraq, the government has allowed most businesses to reopen in the last few weeks but plans to reinstate a 24-hour curfew over the holiday and streets were busy in the days leading up to Eid as people shopped for clothes, toys and home appliances.

But even in countries that have largely reopened, the holiday will not be the same.

Although most restrictions have lifted in Jerusalem, the Al-Aqsa mosque, which is the third holiest site in Islam, will remain closed until after the holiday.

Shopkeepers in the Old City, which has been emptied of tourists and pilgrims since March, are reeling from the effects of six weeks of lockdown.

The Jafar family's famous sweets shop in the Old City is normally a hive of activity, with tourists and locals enjoying knafeh, a syrupy cheese-filled pastry, but these days the seating area is empty and dark as only takeout is allowed.

Shop owner Ali Jafar said business has plummeted by more than two thirds, forcing them to lay off 10 workers.

In Egypt, authorities have extended the nighttime curfew, which will now begin at 5pm instead of 9pm, and halted public transportation until May 29. Shopping centres, beaches and parks, which would ordinarily be packed, will be closed.

Lockdown measures among countries celebrating Eid Saudi Arabia has enforced a nationwide 24-hour curfew starting Saturday that will continue into next week in a bid to curb rising cases. Turkey is imposing a four-day national lockdown over Eid and is extending travel restrictions across 15 provinces for 15 days. Qatar has announced the closure of non-essential shops for 10 days and has told all citizens they must download a tracking app to monitor those coming into contact with people who have tested positive for coronavirus. Those who don't comply with the rules face a three-year prison sentence. In Malaysia people will be allowed to visit relatives who live nearby but gatherings are limited to 20.

Manal Zakaria, who lives in the city of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast, said her family usually celebrates by gathering for big meals, singing, dancing and taking group photos.

'I am very, very, very sad because I will not be seeing my siblings and their children,' she said.

'No matter how much we talk over the phone, there is nothing like coming together.'

In war-ravaged Somalia, authorities have urged the cancellation of large gatherings and celebrations, but it's unclear whether that will be enforced.

Shoppers have packed into markets and shopping centres in the capital, Mogadishu, in recent days.

In the United Arab Emirates parks and private beaches will be open but groups will be limited to five people.

Children under 12 and adults over 60 are barred from shopping centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and other restrictions limit the number of people allowed inside with restaurants only allowed to operate at 30 per cent of capacity.

Joel Fitzgibbon, the opposition party's agricultural minister, said the Australian government was damaging relations with its biggest trading partner.

He accused the Morrison government of deliberately 'offending the Chinese' by making a series of calls for the inquiry, which China has finally agreed to.

Mr Morrison's remarks were met with disdain by some Chinese government officials, with an unprecedented 80 per cent tariff since slapped on barley exports.

China is Australia's biggest trading partner, buying 35 per cent of all exports.

'The world was always going to have an inquiry into COVID-19. Of course it was,' Mr Fitzgibbon told ABC.

The relationship between Australia and China has become tense during the former's calls for an independent coronavirus inquiry (pictured, a wet market in Guangzhou on May 4)

'And China was always going to agree to an inquiry because it’s in China’s interests too, in the medium to long term.

'So what was the interest the prime minister was pursuing?

'Running out there, in front of the pack, not knowing what model he was talking about, without consulting anyone … How did that help Australia?

'We didn’t need to be out there in front, offending the Chinese.'

China has insisted the barley tariffs are unrelated to the cornavirus inquiry, but are instead the result of a long-standing investigation into dumping - where prices are artificially altered.

In fact, Chinese President Xi Jinping was one of the last world leaders to sign the World Health Assembly resolution to hold the inquiry.

But it is a period of tense relations between the two nations, with Chinese officials making a series of barbed remarks about Australia.

Chinese foreign minister Zhao Lijian last week accused Australia 'politicising' the COVID-19 pandemic by calling for an inquiry.

Mr Fitzgibbon also accused Mr Morrison, as well as his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, of 'demonising China' by tightening foreign investment rules.

His comments go against the Labor party's agreed position on the situation, The Australian reported.

The party's leader, Anthony Albanese, has shown strong support for taking action on China in response to the barley tariffs, as well as praising the idea of an inquiry.

'We supported (the review) on day one … We supported it consistently. In the end, this was a EU resolution. It’s a good thing,' he told Sky News on Wednesday.

It comes after a Chinese commentator accused of Australia of being a 'frustrating' and 'un-friendly' trading partner.

The Global Times, a mouthpiece for the communist government, accused Australia of 'exploiting' China and presenting itself 'as a victim'.

On Monday, China announced the 80.5 per cent levy on barley exports would start on Tuesday, after weeks of threatening to boycott Australian industries.

Australia sends between half and two-thirds of all its barley to China, making the tariff decision a massive blow to the $600 million a year industry.

Trade Minister Simon Birmingham revealed the government was given no advanced notice of China's decision and called it 'deeply disappointing'.

'From China's perspective, Australia has never been a friendly trading partner,' a piece in the state-run Global Times said.

'And consultations with the country on trade issues have always been frustrating, which has apparently weakened its motivation to promote bilateral trade.

'The Australian government seems more interested in exploiting China's suspension of some beef imports and its potential imposition of tariffs on Australian barley to describe itself as a victim of trade sanctions.'

AUSTRALIAN BARLEY: IN NUMBERS Between half and two-thirds of all Australian barley is sold to China. Barley is grown across 4,035,000 hectares, with the largest amount being grown in Western Australia. Australia’s grains industry accounts for more than 170,000 jobs across Australia from farm to export dock. About 65 per cent of Australia’s overall grain produced is exported. This includes up to 90 per cent of that grown per in Western Australia and South Australia. Source: National Farmers Federation Advertisement

'We learnt through the official notification that the Chinese Government made. It's a deeply disappointing decision particularly for Australian barley farmers,' Mr Birmingham told Today on Tuesday morning.

'This is a decision that reflects on the Chinese Government. We'll look at the details of it carefully and closely. It is a deeply disappointing decision.

'We'll analyse all the details of it thoroughly and reserve all our rights in terms of how we appeal, how we respond.'

The tariff, to remain in place for five years, is set to cripple Australia's drought-affected grain farmers.

Christine Archer was denied permission to fly from New Zealand to Australia to visit her terminally ill sister Gail Baker on four occasions due to travel restrictions introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But following media attention into their story and persistence, the Australian Government approved Ms Archer's request to fly into Sydney and travel up the New South Wales coast to see her sister.

Ms Baker was diagnosed with incurable ovarian cancer in late March, after both nations moved to ban international travel. She has perhaps weeks to live.

Return travellers in Australia are normally required to spend 14-days in hotel quarantine.

Family friends then drove the retired nurse to Bowraville, about five hours north of Sydney.

Ms Archer hugged her younger sibling in the front garden of Ms Baker's home on Wednesday.

It was their first reunion in six years.

'Words can't explain how I feel, to be honest,' Ms Archer said.

'I'm just so happy that I finally got to be here and be with her.

'The last two weeks have been the hardest or the longest two weeks of my life.'

Ms Archer was surprised that her persistence paid off but is adamant Australia made the right choice in allowing her to remain with her sister during her final days.

'I wondered whether the Australian government had any compassion at all with their rejections,' Ms Archer said.

'I honestly don't know what they were thinking. I know it's an awful time at the moment with the virus… but, I mean, there are some things you've got to be a bit lenient on and I felt this was one of them.

'I didn't think I was ever going to see Gail again. That would've been the worst thing in the world if that had happened.'

Australia's Department of Home Affairs relented on Ms Archer's travel application after it allowed the New Zealand Warriors rugby league team to relocate from Auckland in preparation for the Australian football competition restarting next week.

The department declined to explain its change of heart on the sisters' reunion, saying in a statement it did not comment on individual cases.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Friday venues in New South Wales would be able to host 50 patrons from June 1 if they adhered to the distancing rules.

Ms Berejiklian noted: 'There is no mingling, no standing around. There are strict guidelines in place, which will ensure that we can do this safely.'

Singles have been forbidden from mingling with strangers and couples will be unable to cuddle in strict coronavirus social distancing laws for venues in New South Wales

Customers will have to be seated at tables and must have four square meters per person.

The Premier ruled that there would be no chances of new romance and declared mingling with strangers was frowned upon.

'You have to be seated at the table, you have to be served at the table,' Ms Berejiklian said.

The four-square metre rule will also mean no close contact or cuddling for couples and dates in restaurants.

Other restrictions include no buffets or shared cutlery and bookings will be limited to 10 people.

Diners will have to register their name and phone number when they enter the premises so they can be contacted in the event of a coronavirus outbreak.

The Premier said she made the move to get Australians back into work after 210,000 lost their jobs in the state in April.

'We are making sure people aren't long-term unemployed, and that we can bounce back from the devastating economic shock,' she said.

Deputy Premier John Barilaro said the move was a big boost for regional areas.

'It's our happy hour, time to wine and dine,' he said.

'We want to see people visiting the regions visiting hotels, pubs, clubs, restaurants and cafes.

'Today's announcement will allow regional businesses and economies to embrace, with the opening up of travel, the opportunity for businesses right into the June long weekend to fill their registers.'

'A morale boost and the additional economic stimulus provided by pubs and clubs is what our communities need and I look forward to enjoying a beer in the bush with locals very soon.'

NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the Government was moving to swiftly and safely get businesses back in business and people back to work.

'There are about 280,000 people employed in this sector of the economy and allowing venues to safely cater for more customers will provide another boost to business and jobs,' Mr Perrottet said.

'NSW is opening back up for business, and as we ease restrictions everybody needs to follow the health and safety guidelines, to ensure we make it a success and can continue.'

Deputy Premier John Barilaro said the move was a big boost for regional areas

Minister for Customer Service Victor Dominello, who is responsible for liquor and gaming regulation, said the NSW Government has met with both AHA and ClubsNSW to deliver this plan.

Victoria has announced that 20 people will be allowed in a restaurant or cafe at once from June 1.

Queensland currently caps numbers at 10 and will allow 20 from 12 June.

Douce was arrested two days after the Woolworths incident after being identified through CCTV footage and tested for coronavirus.

Douce did not have the deadly virus.

'Is this because I licked all that s**t at the shops,' he said when he was arrested.

'I thought it would be funny because everyone else is freaking out about it and I'm not scared because I'm not going to get sick.'

Douce pleaded guilty to eight charges including two counts of public nuisance and one count of contamination of goods with intent.

The prosecution argued over what would be an appropriate punishment as there was no precedence for a case such as this.

Prosecutor Monique Sheppard slammed Douce's actions as 'idiotic' and potentially harmful.

With consumer prices inflation having plunged to 0.8 per cent in April, you could be forgiven for thinking a suggestion of a return to the bad old days of high inflation is wrongheaded.

And it’s certainly true that pressing the pause button on consumer economies around the world is going to be deflationary in the short term.

Yesterday’s ONS figures showed the inflation rate almost halved from 1.5 per cent in March, largely driven by a dramatic slump in petrol prices and energy costs.

CPI inflation dropped to just 0.8 per cent in April, the ONS revealed yesterday

The dive in CPI is likely to continue and we could even see it go negative, bringing deflation.

Set against that it is easy to understand why there seems to be little concern that a colossal wave of money printing by central banks, such as the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve, and the spectacular bout of largesse by governments will be inflationary.

In contrast, as I wrote in this column a few weeks ago, there is an outlier idea gaining traction that central banks could simply print the money to buy the government debt needed to fund rescue schemes.

Rather than impose tax rises and spending cuts that will hamper their economies for years to come, this would effectively allow governments to write off the cost of the great coronavirus rescue.

Wouldn’t this be highly inflationary?

‘No,’ say proponents. To heavily simplify their argument, they suggest the inflationary effect of all that printed money will be nullified by the deflationary effect of the coronavirus measures.

It’s as if lockdown created a giant deflationary economic pothole and the printed money just fills it.

There is another side to the argument, however, as we feature today from Pete Comley, the author of the book Inflation Matters, who along with some others says a wave of inflation will be the ultimate result.

I seriously doubt we will see double-digit inflation - but I do think it's worth listening to the argument

I don't know which end of this debate is right - and I seriously doubt we will see double-digit inflation - but I do think it's worth listening to the argument.

Pete puts forward the case that the coronavirus lockdowns will be deflationary in the short-term, but that the effects of quantitative easing money-printing will be different to the financial crisis era.

Pete says: ‘The extra money created in the 2009 Quantitative Easing mainly repaired bank balance sheets and did not reach the man in the street and so did not affect consumer prices much.

‘In contrast, the new money today is being injected directly into the real economy and will be inflationary.’

Pete Comley argues that while in the short-term the coronavirus crash will prove to be deflationary, money printing will lead to a huge inflation spike at the end of the 2020s

The problem we will then face is that central banks and governments will go easy on inflation, which risks it spiralling.

In the absence of any appetite for widespread tax rises, or another dose of austerity, the government and Bank of England will indulge in financial repression to erode the value of the debts built up.

This involves allowing inflation to run above interest rates and means that the value of the extra borrowed money gets whittled away.

In Britain, our big mortgages and sizeable personal debt pile, provide another reason for not wanting to increase interest rates by much.

Pete says: ‘The UK government is likely to allow inflation to rise and will use it as a form of “inflation tax”.

‘There is a precedent for this. Historically, governments have not paid back borrowing created in national emergencies. Instead they have used inflation to reduce the value of a country’s debts in real terms and to make interest repayments more affordable.

‘They are also likely to hold base rates near zero for a long time to reduce their interest payments.’

Even the return of 5 to 10 per cent inflation over a prolonged period would seriously shake up our personal finances

He forecasts that inflation could even return to near double-digit levels towards the end of this decade, before a 140-year long inflationary wave breaks and a price crash follows.

Setting what a price crash could mean for us to one side, even the return of 5 to 10 per cent inflation over a prolonged period would seriously shake up our personal finances.

There is a big chunk of the working population for whom this is not something they have experienced in their adult life – yours truly included.

Our parents’ generation lived through the high inflation and high interest rate years and regularly warn us that it wasn’t much fun.

Yet, at least wages rose at a fair clip back then. Whereas, in today’s corporate world low wage growth is firmly entrenched and workers’ bargaining power is greatly reduced.

There’s a strong possibility that even if inflation rose to 7 per cent, wage rises would remain stuck at 3 per cent.

An inflationary spike could also cause a major headache for investors.

Warnings of the return of high inflation have proved repeatedly unfounded

Bonds are the ‘safe’ part of their portfolios and have remarkably proved much safer than most thought they would as crisis hit again.

They won’t be your friend if inflation spikes, however, leading the interest rate returns on existing bonds looking very unattractive and causing prices to slump.

Pete points out that shares will be the thing to invest in, but adds that high inflation will cause companies problems and also shave a lot off ‘real’ after-inflation returns from investing in the stock market.

This is not to say that any of this will happen. Warnings of the return of inflation have proved unfounded repeatedly over the past couple of decades.

It’s an argument worth considering though.",15,Low,Right

Campaigners yesterday called for the Chancellor to intervene urgently, warning that firms face going bust every day because of the lack of cashflow to keep them afloat.

Taxpayers are footing a huge part of the bill for the non-payments, which has forced companies to put more staff on furlough.

And the cost to the public purse could skyrocket as more and more businesses face bankruptcy without the lifeline of the insurance payouts.

Over the past decade some companies have paid more than £40,000 for the business interruption cover — which they chose because it was promoted as being wide-ranging — but are now not receiving a penny.

Their premiums helped drive huge profits for the insurance firms and vast rewards for their bosses — with the chief executive of Lloyd's of London underwriter Hiscox making more than £2.5 million in the past two years alone.

Small-business owners say the refusal to pay their claims is an exceptionally 'bitter betrayal' because Hiscox boasts that it offers its clients 'peace of mind, by providing advice, expertise, a safety net or simply an arm around them when they need it most'.

Its stated company values also include 'integrity' and 'doing the right thing, however hard' and, just six months ago, CEO Bronek Masojada insisted: 'Paying claims is what we are here for.'

Theresa May's hairdressers facing disaster A family hairdressing business that has operated for more than 50 years faces bankruptcy if it does not receive its insurance payout. Three generations of the Giamattei clan run the Marc Antoni salon chain that now employs 60 staff and boasts former PM Theresa May as a customer. The company has been paying premiums to Hiscox via a broker for about a decade on each of their branches in Fleet, Henley on Thames, Woodley, Wokingham, Caversham and Bracknell. Three generations of the Giamattei clan run the Marc Antoni salon chain that now employs 60 staff and boasts former PM Theresa May as a customer Last year the total bill was £4,304, which included cover for closure caused by 'an occurrence of notifiable human disease'. But despite weeks of inquiries, they were told on April 17 that their claim had been rejected by the insurer, leaving them with a battle for survival. Director Julie Giamattei has had to take out a £300,000 loan to cover the rent costs of all of her salons, but with huge overheads it will still be a struggle to continue the business without the £500,000 payout they believe is due from the insurer. 'It's been awful, an absolute nightmare,' she says. 'We haven't stopped. There have been many sleepless nights for the whole family. 'The directors, all family, have put our houses up as personal guarantees on long leases and loans, and we could potentially lose our homes.' They were told by their broker that the claim had been rejected because they closed the salons on the Saturday, two days before Boris Johnson announced the lockdown. Julie says: 'We were trying to be responsible and stop the spread, like most other businesses were doing. 'You can't get any closer contact than being a hair stylist — but this is how they punish us for doing the right thing.' The company was started by her father-in-law Bruno Giamattei in 1966. His four sons and their children also work in the salons. Julie adds: 'We will keep fighting this battle for our staff and for all our wonderful customers.'

FTSE 100 giant RSA and Australia's QBE are among several other firms under fire.

Most business interruption policies only cover common hazards that can put a firm out of action, such as fire and flooding. But some specifically promise to cover disruption caused by infectious diseases.

Despite this, insurance companies are rejecting claims, in some cases arguing that Covid-19 is not covered because it is a new disease, or that the impact of the Government lockdown is not included in the policy.

Simon Ager, whose Northampton-based Pinnacle Climbing and Caving Centre faces huge challenges without the expected £100,000 insurance payout, has organised Hiscox Action Group which now has 500 members, most of whom have unpaid cover worth the same amount.

'Our insurer's trying to wriggle out of paying' The boss of a family-run IT firm warned that taxpayers would end up footing the bill for his insurers refusal to pay out. James Gulliver, managing director of family-run Netmatters in Wymondham, Norfolk, has been forced to furlough more of the 70 staff because of Hiscox's 'immoral' decision to refuse to pay the £100,000 he says they are due. He started the company with his brother Chris 12 years ago and has been paying Hiscox for business interruption and building insurance cover. James Gulliver (right) started Netmatters with his brother Chris (left) 12 years ago and has been paying Hiscox for business interruption and building insurance cover He says: 'We built up the business gradually and have always been very risk-adverse, taking out insurance to cover us if the worst did happen. 'Now I just think, why did we bother?' He said coronavirus is without question the worst thing his business has had to deal with. He adds: 'It's terrifying what has happened. But everyone else — customers, staff, suppliers and the Government — has tried to do their best in these troubled times. 'Our insurer is the only bad guy, trying to wriggle out of any liability. 'It's really not what you expect from a supposedly reputable insurer. 'Our No 1 goal is to keep all our staff in jobs, and we have got a plan in place to do this, but this has meant we had to furlough more staff at more expense to the taxpayer. 'The whole country is paying for this failure by the insurance company to pay up, not just the businesses directly impacted.' The company's policy stated Hiscox would pay out if the company was unable to use its premises due to outbreak of 'any human infectious or human contagious disease' of which the local authority had been notified. But when they requested the payout they were told that this cover would only apply when there was an incident within a one-mile radius of the insured premises which led to official measures that prevented entry. The insurer said an example would be where the police cordon off the area surrounding a riot or a hotel is evacuated by the police following a nearby gas leak or fire. 'The multitude of wide-ranging measures the Government is taking to contain the coronavirus pandemic are very different in nature,' a spokesman explains. James says: 'This makes no sense. It's there in black and white that we would be covered, but they are trying to say 'we didn't really mean that'. 'It's morally wrong. A lot of firms will probably go out of business because this was their lifeline. 'Many smaller companies could not survive without the hundred grand.'

The group is bringing a case against the insurer with law firm Mishcon de Reya. Mr Ager says tens of thousands of jobs are at risk among the companies in his group alone if the payouts do not start soon.

He adds: 'It seems the only people Hiscox is interested in serving is their shareholders. Brokers promoted the Hiscox policy because it has a wide range of cover — that's why we bought it.

'If insurers don't have to comply with basic contract law and can effectively change the policy when it suits, why should anyone ever buy insurance?'

The Financial Conduct Authority says it intends to present a judge with a sample of the most frequently used policy wordings from a range of different insurers which 'are giving rise to uncertainty'.

But Mr Ager says: 'Court action could drag on for months and by the time they get this resolved thousands of small business might have gone bust. It doesn't need a long court battle. Every lawyer we have shown this to has said we have a clear cut case.'

Simon Sloane, a lawyer with Fieldfisher who is acting on behalf of clients in dispute with Hiscox, RSA and QBE, says: 'This insurance would have been in their premium. It was part of the deal, so the insurance companies should now pay up.

Climbing centre facing cliff edge A climbing centre is facing a financial mountain to climb after being refused a 'vital' £100,000 insurance payment. Father-of-two Simon Ager says the Pinnacle Climbing Centre, which he runs with his wife Cee, currently has 'zero income but lots of costs' after being forced to shut during lockdown. Simon Ager says the Pinnacle Climbing Centre currently has 'zero income but lots of costs' after being forced to shut during lockdown He says: 'It's a small business but I've always tried to run it responsibly, which included buying good insurance to protect the company, our staff and the people we served.' He thought the Northampton-based company, which has ten full-time staff and 25 freelancers, would be covered because he had a policy including financial losses for businesses unable to trade following 'an occurrence of any human infectious or human contagious disease'. But despite Chancellor Rishi Sunak saying the Government's initial recommendation for people not to visit leisure businesses was enough to satisfy insurance claims, Hiscox rejected the claim. Simon says: 'The brokers promoted this policy because it has a wide range of cover.'

'But at the moment there is a blanket refusal by insurers because they always fight where they don't want to set a precedent. Even if they agree in the end, many businesses will have gone under by then.'

Most companies with this form of business interruption insurance would be entitled to £100,000, meaning that for 10,000 businesses the total owed would be £1 billion.

A Hiscox spokesman says: 'We understand these are incredibly difficult times for businesses and we are paying claims covered by the policies we issue fairly and quickly.

'We don't comment on individual claims but, as the Financial Conduct Authority has said, most UK small business policies across the industry do not cover pandemics. Along with the Association of British Insurers, we welcome the FCA's recent initiative to accelerate resolution of disputes.'

The boss making a mint Just six months ago he insisted: 'Paying claims is what we are here for.' Today, the multi-millionaire chief executive of one of the UK's oldest and most respected insurance companies is accused of abandoning thousands of long-serving customers at the time they need him the most. In the past two years alone, Bronek Masojada has earned more than £2.5 million running the 119-year-old Lloyd's-listed Hiscox. Oxford-educated Mr Masojada became chief executive of the company in 2000 and has overseen a remarkable success story. Last year it had gross premiums worth £3.2 billion and enjoyed pre-tax profits of around £153 million over the past two years. It employs more than 3,300 people in 14 countries. The firm's London offices are festooned in fine art, including a Damien Hirst skull by the boardroom and a Polly Morgan piece depicting a stuffed squirrel squeezed into a champagne glass. The company is officially based in the corporate tax haven of Bermuda. In the UK, South African-born Mr Masojada and his wife Jane live in a £1.5 million house in Woldingham, Surrey.

An FCA spokesman says: 'Our legal action . . . is the quickest route to clarity and by covering multiple policies and insurers, it will also be of most use across the market.'

An Association of British Insurers spokesman says: 'Unfortunately, no country in the world has an insurance market that is able to offer widespread pandemic cover.'

Policy wording versus reality:

Hiscox Covers: 'Your inability to use the insured premises due to restrictions imposed by a public authority during the period of insurance following... an occurrence of any human infectious or human contagious disease, an outbreak of which must be notified to the local authority.'

What it told claimants: 'The restrictions the Government has imposed are part of its national response to reduce the impact of the coronavirus pandemic; they were not issued following or in response to 'an occurrence' at any specific location, placing them outside the scope of the policy.'

QBE Covers: 'Any human infectious or human contagious disease . . . an outbreak of which the local authority has stipulated shall be notified to them . . . within a 25-mile radius' [of the premises.]

What it told claimants: Cover only provided 'where loss is in consequence of the occurrence of Covid-19 at the relevant locations and not where losses are in consequence of . . . wide-scale government measures.'

RSA Covers: Loss as a result of closure or restrictions placed on the premises as a result of a notifiable human disease manifesting itself at the premises or within a radius of 25 miles.

What it told claimants: Requires evidence of losses due to a specific local outbreak that led directly to closure or restrictions.

The policy does not cover losses arising from a general reduction in the number of bookings or increased cancellations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Moving in the right direction: As investors, we have lessons to learn about how stock markets and assets react under extreme stress, like during a pandemic

Lesson 1: Tech stocks aren't the biggest risk

Investors old enough to remember the 2000 dotcom boom and the biggest casualties from the 2008 global financial crisis have an inherent belief that technology equals risk.

But as stock markets plunged around the globe due to Covid-19, tech stocks remained some of the stars of the show. 'One important lesson from the pandemic has been that technology stocks are not necessarily the riskiest part of the market during a downturn,' says Annabel Brodie-Smith, communications director for the Association of Investment Companies.

She adds: 'Shares in household names such as Apple, Facebook and Google have performed relatively strongly, highlighting the more central role their products and services are playing in our lives.'

Brodie-Smith points out the strong performance of investment companies Allianz Technology and Polar Capital Technology, up 32.3 per cent and 42.5 per cent this year respectively, as an illustration.

She says: 'While there's no knowing what the future holds, it may be that habits formed during lockdown – such as holding more meetings remotely – will continue after life returns to normal, further boosting the tech sector.'

Allianz Technology has Microsoft and Amazon as its two biggest holdings, followed by cyber security group Crowdstrike.

Polar Capital Technology holds Microsoft, Google parent company Alphabet, and Apple as its top three stocks.

Lesson 2: Bonds aren't too boring

Before Covid-19, it was easy to dismiss the benefits of bonds as part of an investment strategy.

A ten-year bull market in equities meant their performance seemed a lag on many portfolios, but the recent behaviour of the stock market shows their importance.

'Apart from cash, government bonds and corporate bonds were the only global asset classes in positive territory in the first quarter of this year,' says Dzmitry Lipski, head of fund research at wealth manager Interactive Investor.

'What this teaches us from an investment perspective is that while there are few places to hide when the global economic system takes a hit, portfolio diversification is absolutely crucial – by both geography and by asset class.'

Lipski says that both multi-asset investment funds and some investment trusts can help ensure your portfolio has exposure to both bonds and equities.

He adds: 'The Vanguard LifeStrategy 80 per cent Equity Fund has been excellent and is a low-cost global one-stop shop for those wanting global equity exposure with a decent chunk of high quality bond exposure too. 'It's suitable for both first-time and experienced investors.'

For those more wedded to bonds, Vanguard also has a 60 per cent equity product. The 80 per cent LifeStrategy Fund is up 0.8 per cent this year and 40.4 per cent over five years. It has a mix of holdings in other Vanguard funds to create a multi-asset profile. Its top holding is a FTSE AllShare Index-tracking fund and its bond holdings include UK gilts and index-linked gilts as well as corporate bonds.

The FTSE 100 has joined other major stock markets around the world in bouncing off its lows

Lesson 3: Fear can be the enemy of growing wealth

It is a well-known cliche that markets are driven by fear and greed. Veteran investor Warren Buffett says the secret of success is to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.

The sharp falls, and similarly sharp recoveries on the stock market during the pandemic, have borne out Buffett's wisdom.

James Norton, senior investment planner at Vanguard, says the trajectory of world stock markets in recent months has shown little mercy to those who are fearful. He explains: 'When things go wrong, our emotions take over and fear sets in. It's a survival instinct and we are programmed to take action. For example, if the boiler in our house breaks, we call the plumber, the boiler is fixed and we move on.

Selling an investment portfolio is likely to provide instant gratification... but it's nearly always the wrong thing to do

'When stock markets fall, the same instincts are triggered. We are losing money and want to stop the losses. For many, the first thought is to sell up and move into cash.

'Selling an investment portfolio is likely to provide instant gratification. We feel better that we've stemmed the losses and maintained what's left of our hard-earned investment. But it's nearly always the wrong thing to do.'

Michelle Pearce Burke is cofounder and chief investment officer of wealth manager Wealthify. She agrees with Norton.

She says: 'While some stock markets fell by over 30 per cent earlier this year, many recovered some lost ground very quickly. So investors who held their nerve by remaining invested, or even adding money, have done better than those who withdrew at the height of the panic, crystallising losses.'

Lesson 4: Check dividend cover to protect income

Many investors are attracted by a company's dividend and in particular the dividend yield – the amount of annual income you get per share, expressed as a percentage of its price.

The higher the yield, the more attractive the dividend income appears. Yet, as recent widespread dividend cuts have shown, the dividend yield shouldn't be taken as a stand-alone measure of a company's income-friendliness.

What is more important is the robustness of the dividend – its so-called dividend cover.

For example, Shell was the highest yielding oil stock in the world back in March at more than 11 per cent, but its dividend cover was equivalent to just over one times its annual earnings.

What is more important is the robustness of the dividend

In simple terms, this meant that almost everything the company generated in revenues went into paying its dividends. This was an unsustainable position that led to Shell cutting its dividend for the first time since the Second World War.

Other companies in a similar poor dividend state – dubbed members of the 'dividend danger zone' by wealth manager AJ Bell even before the pandemic – include housebuilder Persimmon, which has also postponed its dividend.

Weak dividend cover is not always a guarantee of a company cutting or suspending its dividend. For example, mobile phone giant Vodafone announced a few days ago it was holding its dividend despite having low dividend cover.

But it should be seen as a warning sign. You can check the dividend cover for a specific company by visiting its shareholder website. It should provide details of the firm's key financial information including dividends and when they will be paid.

Dividing the total dividend per share by the earnings per share should give you the dividend cover figure.

For those wanting an investment fund that picks dividend winners, Adrian Lowcock, of fund platform Willis Owen, suggests Trojan Income, which is down 4.8 per cent this year but up 16.2 per cent over five years.

He says: 'Manager Francis Brooke takes a conservative approach to investing with a focus on capital preservation. He looks for companies that can produce a steady, long-term income along with capital growth.'

Lesson 5: Look for big government deals

When the outlook for the world economy is uncertain, there is underlying strength in investments underpinned by long-term contracts with organisations that are guaranteed to pay the bills.

The investment performance of infrastructure and social housing funds in the current crisis illustrates this, according to Monica Tepes, head of investment companies research at corporate adviser finnCap.

She says: 'If you are looking for as much certainty as possible that your dividends won't be cut, you need to look at investment sectors where either the local or state government is a counterparty, or your payments come from businesses unaffected or even benefiting from the current environment.'

Infrastructure equity, infrastructure debt and social and supported housing investments are examples of businesses with strong counterparties.

For example, Civitas Social Housing is a real estate investment trust that distributes 90 per cent of its profits from social housing rent as dividends. Its customers are not the tenants, but local authorities and housing associations.

Its shares are up 24 per cent over a year, although investors must be aware that housing associations are not immune to financial risk. Sequoia Economic Infrastructure Income lends to big infrastructure projects.

Shares are down nearly 3 per cent over a year, but up 30 per cent over five. Many of its investments – for example ferries and transport – are under short-term pressure from coronavirus, but should come through the other end of the economic crisis.",15,Low,Right

Many households have been able to save on commuting costs, gym memberships and even takeaway coffee in recent weeks. So how much could we be benefiting from curtailing our spending?

Lucinda Gregory, investment research manager at online broker The Share Centre, says: 'While we wait for our lives to return to normal, one way we can keep ourselves positive during lockdown is by thinking about the potential savings we're making each month while our regular activities are off the cards.'

Figures from Sainsbury's Bank show that the average commuter usually spends as much as ten per cent of their salary on annual train tickets, coming in at £2,605 each year.

For those who haven't been commuting recently, this translates to a chunky saving of around £217 a month.

On top of this, those who have temporarily had to give up their caffeine fix on the way to work could be saving a further £54 a month, while no longer paying for shop-bought lunches could give back an additional £120 a month – assuming a spend of £2.70 and £6 respectively, 20 times a month.

Meanwhile, a tidy sum of money is also being 'saved', thanks to a lack of socialising.

Research by The Share Centre shows that the average person usually spends around £70 on dining out each month and a further £68 on evenings out, while money spent on cinema, theatre and concerts comes to a monthly average of £50.

Driving less frequently also means there are plenty of savings to be had on petrol and diesel costs. Figures from garage firm Kwik Fit suggest that motorists spent around £68 a month on fuel before lockdown.

Those who regularly go to the gym have also been able to claw back around £40 each month, with most gyms, including Virgin Active and Nuffield Health, freezing membership fees while they are closed.

And with no live sport on offer either, large numbers of sports fans have been able to put their sports subscriptions on hold. Sky Sports customers are therefore saving around £23 a month.

In total, this means Britons in lockdown could be benefiting from as much as £710 more in their bank account each month – although this is offset to some degree by higher energy bills while many of us work from home.

Put on hold: Many households have been able to save on commuting costs, gym memberships and even takeaway coffee

Gregory says: 'Many will choose to put these monthly savings towards helping with the monthly bills and essentials, but for those that find themselves with money still spare at the end of the month it is worth making it work as hard as possible.

'With interest rates at a historical low, any savings you accumulate are most likely to be eroded by inflation if simply left in your bank account. Investing this money for the long term in stocks and shares could see these monthly savings grow to a healthy sum in years to come.'

Georgie Killik, of wealth manager Killik and Co, says: 'You don't need a lump sum to get the investment ball rolling; you can start with a small monthly or weekly contribution – even as little as £25.

'Save and invest apps offer the flexibility to contribute cash in ways and amounts that work for you during these times of uncertainty – monthly, sporadically, little and often.'

Research by savings app Chip has revealed that many of us are already putting more money aside and that savings goals have shifted. Saving for a holiday is no longer the number one priority – as it was for a lot of people before the coronavirus pandemic hit.

Instead, many are now focusing on having a savings cushion in place to fall back on if unemployment beckons. Clearing debt has also moved further up the priority list.

Simon Rabin, chief executive and founder of Chip, says: 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, the number one goal we're seeing our savers make at the moment is titled 'safety net' or 'rainy day funds'.

'Also, on average our savers are putting aside 13 per cent more per month than before the pandemic began gripping the nation.'",15,Low,Right

Will it be affected by what is going on now with the coronavirus?

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Retirement concern: Will my final salary pension be affected by the coronavirus crisis?

Steve Webb replies: The good news is that, provided your former employer stays in business, your pension should be safe.

But there is a lot currently going on behind the scenes in the world of final salary – also often called 'defined benefit' - pensions which it might be useful to be aware of.

If you are in a public sector scheme, such as those for teachers, nurses or civil servants, you have nothing to worry about.

Most public sector schemes are funded out of taxation, so things like movements in stock markets or companies going out of business will not affect whether your pension is paid.

But assuming you worked in the private sector, your pension promise is backed by a fund which has been set aside to pay your pension, and those of your fellow workers, today and into the future.

That money is overseen by a group of trustees who have to make decisions about how best to invest the money and how the scheme should be run.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

Every three years, your scheme goes through a valuation process.

They look at all the pensions that are due to be paid over the coming decades and compare this with the returns they expect to get on the money that sits in the fund.

If there is a shortfall (or a 'deficit') then the Pensions Regulator will expect the scheme to come up with a plan for dealing with it. This is known as a 'recovery plan'.

It usually involves the employer agreeing to make additional payments over a number of years until the deficit is closed.

The impact of coronavirus on all of this will vary from scheme to scheme. Where schemes were invested heavily in shares, the recent stock market falls mean that the assets held by the scheme will have dropped.

Really low interest rates are also bad news for company pension schemes. This is because if returns are low, you need to set aside more money now to pay for future pension promises.

These two factors together mean that for many schemes, deficits are now likely to be much bigger as a result of the current crisis.

Normally, when deficits go up, employers have to put extra money into the pension fund. But, at the moment, many employers have very little cash.

So the Pensions Regulator is allowing employers to put off making payments into schemes for a three month period if necessary.

As long as this doesn't go on for too long, it should be possible to make up for lost time and get the pension funding level back up.

What you need to know about final salary pension transfers Seven questions to ask yourself to help spot red flags BEFORE you fork out for financial advice. Read a guide to the pros and cons of abandoning guaranteed final salary pensions here.

But if the economy takes a long-term hit then a combination of increased deficits and reduced contributions is storing up problems for final salary pension schemes.

The big problem would be if coronavirus means that your former employer goes out of business, perhaps because they are in a sector of the economy which has been hardest hit.

If this were to happen at a time when the pension scheme did not have enough money set aside to pay all of its future pensions, then the chances are you would see some impact.

If the pension scheme was significantly short, it would be likely to end up in the 'lifeboat' Pension Protection Fund, assuming your scheme was registered in the UK.

You can read more about the PPF here, but in brief, the PPF would take over all of the assets of your pension scheme and would then pay benefits out to you from now on.

The basic level of payment would be 100 per cent of your pension if you were over scheme pension age when the firm went bust and 90 per cent if you were under.

There are also limits on the pensions which would be paid out to the highest earners.

The main difference you would see in future would be that annual increases for inflation could well be lower if the PPF is paying your pension rather than your old scheme.

But at least you have the security of knowing that the PPF is there and you cannot lose all your pension.",15,Low,Right

The economy shrank by nearly 6 per cent in March alone, the worst fall since monthly records began in 1997.

The Bank of England expects an economic slump of 25 per cent in this quarter and 2020 is set to suffer from the deepest recession since 1706.

Even worse perhaps, economists say that we will not see a full recovery until 2022 at the earliest. The figures and forecasts are deeply depressing for thousands of firms.

When one door closes: Insolvency firm FRP Advisory is at its most profitable when other firms are collapsing

But they are likely to spell good news for one corner of the economy – insolvency practices.

These firms thrive in hard times, and one example is FRP Advisory, which specialises in selling off companies that are beyond repair, as well as helping businesses back on their feet if they have fallen into only temporary financial distress.

FRP was listed on the stock market on March 6, one of the few successful flotations of recent months.

Priced at just 80p, FRP shares have since shot up to £1.24, but they have long-term potential, too.

The firm was floated when stock markets were tumbling, the UK had yet to enter lockdown and few could predict the full economic impact of coronavirus. Since then, conditions have changed dramatically.

FRP is far smaller than the big accountancy firms such as PwC and Deloitte, but manages to punch well above its weight. In the past few weeks alone, the group has been appointed to sort out Debenhams and the restaurant chain Carluccio's.

Laura Ashley may well be on the list, too, while other high profile cases include BHS, Patisserie Valerie and Aquascutum.

FRP was founded by Geoff Rowley and Jeremy French, both with decades of experience in the corporate restructuring field. The duo worked together at Vantis, an accountancy firm that grew too fast and itself came to an untimely end in 2010.

Rowley and French's part of the group was in good shape, however, so they bought it from the administrators and set up their own shop, taking 170 people with them. Learning from Vantis's mistakes, they have run FRP with extreme caution, and the business has gone from strength to strength, now employing 360 staff.

Turnover rose from £17.4 million in the year to April 2011 to £54.3 million in the year to April 2019, while profits soared even faster. Last week, Rowley revealed that turnover would rise more than 16 per cent to £63.2 million for the year to April 30, 2020, comfortably ahead of expectations.

Profits of just over £14 million are expected, rising to at least £16.2 million in the 12 months to April 2021. A dividend of 0.7p is forecast for the year just ended, rising to 3.9p for the current year.

FRP intends to be generous on the dividend front, making half-yearly payments this year but moving to quarterly distributions in 2021.

As a business that generates most of its money from companies in trouble, FRP is well positioned for the coming months. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has stepped in to help firms and their employees, but that support will not last indefinitely.

Once it is withdrawn, thousands of firms face an uncertain future. Payments for FRP's assignments range in value from a few thousand pounds to several million.

The group tackles about 1,500 cases a year and that number should rise as the company expands and the economy droops. Rowley and French have built a strong culture across the group, centred on fairness and a desire to help struggling businesses wherever possible.

The group has other strings to its bow, including a forensic services division, which delves into fraud and bribery allegations. After ten years as a privately-owned business, Rowley and French floated FRP primarily to fund growth and promote the business.

They also made some money for themselves, raising £57million from the flotation that was shared among 50 partners. The partners remain heavily invested in FRP, however, collectively owning just over 50 per cent of the company.

They were also keen to reward employees, so every staff member has been granted shares - a move that should encourage team spirit and a group-wide commitment to success.

Midas verdict: Insolvency firms are widely feared and often loathed, accused of profiteering from companies in trouble. FRP tries to be more sympathetic and prides itself on talking straight and acting fair.

The approach has worked so far and should continue to hold good, especially as our economy tilts downwards. At £1.24, the shares should prove rewarding – and the dividend is an extra perk.

It offered me the chance to rebook or vouchers but I do not have any future travel plans, so wanted my money back.

I followed some links on its site for cancelled flights, which took me through to an EU 261 flight compensation form that I filled in.

However, I have now got an email back saying that I am not entitled to anything under EU 261, but can have vouchers or rebook future flights.

Is it right that I cannot claim compensate and how do I get a refund?

One passenger tried to claim compensation for his cancelled flights through the EU261 law

Grace Gausden, This is Money, replies: Since the outbreak of the coronavirus has stalled nearly all flights in and out of the country and led to widespread cancellations, passengers have been trying to claw their money back.

By law, those who booked with an airline and had their flight cancelled directly are entitled to be fully recompensed in cash, as opposed to a credit voucher or the option to rebook alternative flights.

However, many airlines have not followed this and instead tried to force customers to rebook or take a voucher, causing uproar from those who just want their money back.

When you weren't presented with the option for a cash refund by EasyJet, you followed the cancelled flight links you could find and applied to claim compensation through the EU261 law, as you didn't just want the vouchers or to rebook.

Officially named EC 261/2004, this law was put in by the European Commission place to protect passengers rights.

It allows customers to make claims for compensation if something goes wrong with their flight, for example, if a flight is cancelled or there is a long delay.

If you qualify under EU 261, an airline is obligated to pay you flight cancellation compensation of up to £510.

The law has helped hold airlines to account for practices that had seriously disadvantaged customers in the past, such as overbooking and failing to keep adequate parts sourcing and maintenance plans in place at airports.

The EU regulation, EU 261, gives passengers the right to be reimbursed for flight cancellations

In your case, the EU regulation, EU 261, gives passengers the right to be reimbursed for flight cancellations, on top of their refund or rebooking, providing certain criteria are met.

However, one of the escape clauses for airlines to avoid paying compensation is when a flight is cancelled due to extraordinary circumstances like 'technical difficulties' or 'operational circumstances'.

Unfortunately, this was not clearly defined when the law was written but over time it has been developed into things that the airline could not reasonably forsee as being at risk of happening and planning for.

The coronavirus pandemic is being classed as an extraordinary circumstance and therefore you will not qualify for the compensation.

Nonetheless, you are still entitled to your money back in full and not a voucher or rebooking.

A spokesperson for EasyJet replies: As confirmed by the European Commission, EU261 compensation is not payable if the cancellation of the flight is due Covid-19, because it's an event outside of airlines' control.

Customers on cancelled flights can transfer to an alternative flight free of charge, or receive a voucher for the value of their booking online, or claim a refund through our contact centre.

Customers may also submit a claim in writing via a new dedicated refund webform, online.

If someone wants a refund instead of a voucher they are entitled to ask for their money back

Mark Woloshak, Slater and Gordon dispute resolution lawyer, replies: Despite Covid-19 and the hardship created by the pandemic, the law still applies and you are entitled to a refund.

Anyone with tickets for cancelled flights, leaving from and/or arriving at anywhere inside the European Union, is entitled to refund under EU 261, as well as contractual law.

Many airlines are offering vouchers, instead of cash refunds, for passengers to use on future flights. If, for whatever reason, a person would like a refund instead of a voucher they are entitled to ask for their money back. However, persuading an airline to comply can be more of a challenge.

To receive a refund the passenger will need to email, phone or write to the airline and request their money back. The timeframe in which a person should expect their money back is not specified, but described as ‘whatever is reasonable’. This may be specified flight contracts but shouldn’t be longer than 28 days.

If the money still isn’t refunded, or the airline refuses, a person could make a complaint to their airline involved.

Coby Benson, Flight Delay Compensation Solicitor at Bott and Co said: The first thing to note is that there’s a difference between ‘compensation’ and a ‘refund’.

The airline does not have to provide any compensation (which is usually between €250 and €600 because the circumstances are extraordinary. However, the airline is always obliged to provide a refund when the flight is cancelled.

The law is absolutely clear, the refund should be provided within seven days.

If the airline breaches this law then the passenger can use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), but only if they don’t get a refund after 8 weeks.

They could also issue court proceedings and this should be quicker than ADR, although there’s a fee to pay the court, so it’s slightly riskier.

Grace Gausden adds: If you do want to get your money back, the best thing to do is to contact an airline direct.

Some have online forms that you can fill out for a refund, including Ryanair and now Easyjet, whilst others you have to contact by phone, such as British Airways.

When you first tried to get your money back, EasyJet had temporarily removed its cash refund option online. It is now back.

Whilst filling out the form is relatively easy, passengers have been warned that their refunds may take a while to filter through due to the large volume of requests airlines are receiving.

If the airline does not have an ADR provision a person can complain to the Civil Aviation Authority.

If the airline refuses a refund and your flight cost over £100 and was bought with a credit card, you can claim against the credit card provider.

The Consumer Credit Act provides that where finance is provided to purchase goods or services, a claim lies against the finance provider (in this instance the credit card provider) as well as the supplier if the goods or services are defective.

If the flight cost less than £100 and was purchased with a debit card, the cash back scheme that operates on some debit cards may enable you to claim a refund.

In addition, you might also be able to claim on your holiday insurance policy. You may also find that the airline has ATOL protection if it ceases to trade.

If none of these options are successful you could begin proceeding in a small claims court - but this should always be a last resort.",15,Low,Right

While customers make no payments for three months, credit card providers in most cases still charge interest, meaning borrowers continue to rack up interest.

The interest added during this three-month period pushes up borrowers' balances, inflates the minimum payment they have to pay each month after the holiday and can ultimately take them longer to clear their balance at a higher cost.

Freeze: Applying for a credit card payment holiday means you pay nothing for up to three months, but you will still incur interest despite not paying anything off

Examples from Barclaycard and Santander highlight why only those who really can't afford to make payments at the moment should consider taking payment holidays on things like credit cards, which have higher interest rates than mortgages or unsecured personal loans, even though the balance is likely to be lower.

Instead, someone previously paying off their balance in full or paying a fixed amount could choose to pay a lower sum each month, while someone already paying the minimum could try and speak to their bank to see if they are allowed to make a payment of less than the minimum each month, but still pay something.

Experts said borrowers should be sure to contact their lender before simply applying for a payment holiday, to ensure they are taking the best course of action.

Alternatively, those with a good enough credit score to do so could switch to a card with a lower APR or even an interest-free term, but that is not an option open to everyone.

Could a three-month credit card payment holiday cost you more? Current card balance APR Minimum due each month pre-holiday Minimum due post-holiday Interest added during holiday Estimated additional Interest per year £1,000 18.9% £25 £26 £44 £10 £1,000 21.9% £27 £28 £51 £14 £1,000 29.9% £32 £34 £68 £22 £4,000 18.9% £98 £103 £177 £42 £4,000 21.9% £107 £112 £203 £56 £4,000 29.9% £128 £137 £270 £89 Source: Barclaycard/Santander

Crunching the numbers

Someone with a £4,000 credit card balance on a card with a 21.9 per cent APR would, according to figures from Barclaycard, incur £203 in interest over the course of a three-month payment holiday.

This would push up the minimum amount a borrower had to pay each month from £107 to £112 and see them incur around £56 more a year in interest than if they hadn't taken the holiday.

Take five Credit reference agency Experian recommends borrowers consider five things before they apply for a payment holiday: 1. Choose the right support Most lenders are offering additional support, called forbearance, if you're struggling because of the pandemic. This could be something like reducing or pausing monthly payments. Before you make any decisions, make sure you know what you can afford to repay. 2. Steer clear of missed payments If you're struggling or you think you might miss a payment, don't ignore it or cancel your direct debit. Unauthorised missed payments can lead to penalties and could reduce your credit score. Speak to your lender as soon as possible to discuss all your options, as a lot of banks are waiving missed payment fees provided customers are on a payment holiday and have spoken to them first. 3. Don't forget the interest During your payment holiday interest will still be charged and added to the balance. So, you'll likely see your minimum monthly payments increase when it ends. Keep an eye on your balance so the added interest doesn't put you over your limit. 4. Shop around before you apply Making multiple credit applications can reduce your score. If you apply for credit, use comparison services shop around without damaging your score. That way, you'll only apply for deals you're likely to get and will avoid any unnecessary 'hard' credit searches. 5. Play your cards right Low credit card balances can give your score a boost. If you take a payment holiday, remember that interest will still be charged and added to the balance. So, you may want to make a reduced payment, or try to pay a little as and when you can.

This assumed they didn't add anything more to the card over that holiday and the borrower paid only the minimum amount each month.

It would take 30 years and four months to clear a £4,000 balance paying only the minimum payment each month, and see a borrower charged £6,450 a year in interest.

Taking the three-month holiday but sticking to the slightly higher minimum payment would cost a borrower £348 more in interest and lengthen the time to clear the balance by five months.

If a borrower had a card with a higher APR of 29.9 per cent and the same amount on it, taking a holiday would see them incur £270 in interest and pay £89 a year more than they otherwise would do.

Alastair Douglas, chief executive of credit comparison site Totally Money, said: 'Customers should only really apply for a payment holiday if they need to as a result of coronavirus.

'This is because interest will be added to the existing amount, which makes the overall debt and future repayments more expensive.

'A better option, if possible, is to make smaller repayments and keep on reducing the balance. Anyone who has existing financial difficulties should contact their lender to make other arrangements.'

Nearly 1.2million credit card and personal loan borrowers are on payment holidays at the moment, according to banking trade body UK Finance.

More than 40,000 Santander borrowers have been granted payment holidays as have 393,000 Lloyds Banking Group customers, which includes Halifax and the credit card provider MBNA.

Other banks did not supply individual figures for unsecured borrowers.

While all banks are handling the process differently, most banks require customers to fill out an online form to request a payment holiday, but do not appear to be checking whether borrowers are in financial difficulty before they can take a holiday.

Barclaycard and Lloyds have said customers who have missed one credit card payment or less can take a holiday, while Santander said those behind on their payments can take a holiday.

A similar situation has happened with three-month mortgage holidays, with those whose finances have not been hit in theory able to put their payments on hold for three months, although they shouldn't.

Mr Douglas added: 'While payment holidays are an attractive option for many, people must understand there are added costs involved, and that they must apply for the holiday instead of just stopping payments.

'Get in touch with your lender if you need one. If it's not sorted properly, it will count as a missed payment, which will harm your credit score.'

John Webb, a credit expert at reference agency Experian, said: 'If you're struggling financially because of the pandemic, you might be unable to meet your regular monthly payments.

'If so, it's important to contact banks, lenders and other providers to discuss your situation right away.

'This will allow you both to agree the best course of action.

'Before you agree to a payment holiday on your credit card, remember that interest will still be charged.

'This means your debt will grow and, after the payment holiday, your monthly payment will likely increase.

'This is why it's important to discuss with your lender whether a payment holiday is the right option for you.'",15,Low,Right

The UK has recorded another 363 hospital deaths from COVID-19 today, taking the official total among people who have tested positive to 35,704.

NHS England said 166 people had died in its hospitals, while a further 197 people died in the other three nations and in care homes, private homes elsewhere in the community.

Another 2,472 people have been diagnosed with the virus today, taking the total number of cases to 248,293 - the fifth highest in the world. The government said it had done 177,216 tests in the last 24 hours.

There are 9,953 COVID-19 patients currently in hospitals and 637 were admitted on Monday, May 18, which was down from 711 last Monday.

It comes as Public Health England testing data from yesterday shows that not a single case of COVID-19 have yet been diagnosed in London or the South East from swabs taken on Monday, May 18.

The regions are the two most populated in the country and are home to a combined 18million people - almost a third of the British population.

Officials have played down the numbers, suggesting that they may be the result of a technical hitch known to have happened over the weekend, and explaining that they will rise in the coming days as more results come back. The number should not be interpreted to mean the epidemic is tailing off, they said.

The numbers also showed that only 79 cases were diagnosed across the whole of England - this, too, will inevitably rise in the coming days as more people who were swabbed on Monday test positive. A total of 2,412 people yesterday received positive results from samples taken between May 13 and 18.

But the hopeful figure comes as the number of people catching the virus in Britain is believed to be falling rapidly. Research by the University of Cambridge and Public Health England last week suggested that only 24 people each day are catching COVID-19 in London.

And another expert at the University of Oxford, Professor Carl Heneghan, said that the UK could be on track to hit zero new coronavirus deaths in June. Professor Heneghan, who has been following the statistics closely throughout the outbreak, said: 'I think by the end of June we'll be looking at the data and finding it difficult to find people with this illness, if current trends continue.'

Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, used today's Downing Street briefing to announce hundreds of millions of pounds of extra crisis funding for medium-sized charities and social enterprises, and said he was starting a taskforce to work out how to get sports and arts running again safely.

Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the NHS, said the number of people in hospital is now lower than 10,000 'for the first time since March' and confirmed that all data still points to a 'consistently downwards' trend for the outbreak, which is fizzling out.

Public Health England data has so far found only 79 new coronavirus cases out of specimens provided on May 18. This number will increase in future as more people receive their results

NHS England today said that the newly-announced deaths happened in its hospitals between March 24 and yesterday, May 19, and that five of them had been otherwise healthy before catching the coronavirus.

Most of the fatalities happened in the Midlands (42), followed by North East & Yorkshire (37), East of England (32), North West (21), South East (17), London (13) and South West (4).

It calculated that the crucial 'R' reproduction rate - the average number of people an infected patient passes the virus on to - has fallen to just 0.4 in the capital, with the number of new cases halving every 3.5 days.

TWO METRE SOCIAL DISTANCING RULE 'BASED ON FRAGILE EVIDENCE' One of the top scientific advisers to the British Government said the two metre (6'6"") social distancing rule is based on 'very fragile' evidence. People in the UK have been urged to stay at least 2m, or six-and-a-half feet, away from anyone who they don't live with, to avoid catching or spreading COVID-19. But the distance may be a non-scientific estimate that just caught on in countries around the world, as top researchers say there is not solid evidence to back it up. Professor Robert Dingwall, a sociologist at Nottingham Trent University and a member of government advisory group NERVTAG (New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) made the comments this morning. He said that the World Health Organization and other countries in Europe had reduced this distance to one metre but the UK is persisting with the full 2m. Professor Dingwall said on BBC Radio 4 today: 'The World Health Organization recommends a one metre distance, Denmark has adopted it since the beginning of last week. 'If you probe around the recommendations of distance in Europe you will find that a lot of countries have also gone for this really on the basis of a better understanding of the scientific evidence around the possible transmission of infection.' Iain Duncan-Smith, a former Conservative Party Cabinet minister has also called for the rule to be relaxed, saying it will be impossible to maintain in pubs and restaurants. Advertisement

The Cambridge team estimated that 1.8million people in London (20 per cent) have already had coronavirus.

They claimed between 10 and 53 people in the capital caught the virus on May 10, the day Boris Johnson announced a slight relaxation of some lockdown rules.

At the peak of the capital's crisis - calculated to be the same day lockdown was announced - 213,000 are thought to have caught the infection.

Meanwhile, the team's modelling shows only one death occurs in every 160 cases, suggesting at the current rate, London's daily death toll will drop to a consistent level of zero in three weeks.

At the start of the outbreak London was the worst affected part of the UK but the latest numbers suggest it is now ahead of every other area in terms of recovery and it could see all new cases eliminated by June. In contrast, the North East of England is recording 4,000 daily infections and has an R rate of 0.8, twice that of the capital.

One epidemiologist argued it is 'extremely unlikely' the number of new cases in London is as low as 24.

The data - provided to a sub-committee of the Government's SAGE panel of experts - sparked hopes that the easing of strict measures could be accelerated.

Today's statistics come after separate data from the Office for National Statistics, National Records Scotland and NISRA, the Northern Irish statistical agency, suggested yesterday that at least 44,000 people had died by the middle of last week.

That number includes everyone who had COVID-19 or 'novel coronavirus' mentioned on their death certificate, whether they got tested for it or not. The Department of Health only counts people who test positive.

Britain's status as the worst-hit country in Europe is underlined by the figures, with Italy so far recording 32,000 deaths, by comparison. Only the US has recorded more deaths, with 92,000 victims.

ONS data, which only covers England and Wales, confirmed 39,071 people had died with the coronavirus in all settings by May 8. The figures include patients whose death was suspected to be from COVID-19, as well as those whose were confirmed.

At least 1,211 further people were known to have died in English hospitals between May 9 and May 17, according to the NHS, taking the England and Wales total to 40,282.

In addition, National Records of Scotland - the equivalent of the ONS north of the border - counted 3,213 deaths by May 10, and Northern Ireland's Statistics Agency, NISRA, added 599 up to May 13.

This took the total for the UK to at least 44,094. But the actual number, taking into account more recent counts from Scotland and Northern Ireland, will be even higher.

The ONS revealed that excess deaths - the number of people who have died above the average amount expected for this time of year - has now almost hit 55,000. That figure includes direct and indirect victims of COVID-19, such as people who may have missed medical treatment because hospitals were overloaded.

EARLIER LOCKDOWN 'COULD HAVE SAVED 30,000 LIVES' Triggering lockdown a week earlier could have saved the lives of more than 30,000 people in the UK, according to a shock study. The staggering claim was made by a mathematical sciences expert who predicted how different scenarios could have affected the progress of the outbreak in Britain. He suggests that starting the lockdown, which has now been going for eight weeks, a week earlier on March 16 could have limited the number of deaths to 11,200. Data yesterday confirmed at least 44,000 people had died with COVID-19 across the UK by mid-May, with the death toll set to keep rising in coming weeks. Detailed statistics show that more than 44,000 people have already died with COVID-19 in the UK, but this study from the University of Southampton suggests that number could have been kept to 11,200 if lockdown was introduced earlier Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent the country into lockdown on March 23, 58 days ago, banning people from meeting up with others or making unnecessary trips out of the home. Britain was one of the last countries in Europe to put the rules in place - Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, France, Austria, Spain and Italy had done it days or weeks earlier. Dr John Dagpunar, from the University of Southampton, suggests the UK's decision came too late and thousands of people have died as a result. He said in his paper 'literally, each day's delay in starting lockdown can result in thousands of extra deaths... it does pose the question as to why lockdown did not occur earlier?' Dr Dagpunar's study considered the number of people infected with the virus, its rate of reproduction, hospital bed and staff capacity, and the proportion of patients who die, among other factors. If lockdown had been started a week earlier, on March 16, the model suggested, there could have been a 'very large reduction' in deaths, limiting them to around 11,200. The virus would have infected four per cent less of the population in this scenario (two per cent compared to six per cent), the study said, and the demand for hospital beds would have been lower. Dr Dagpunar said: 'In hindsight [this] clearly illustrates that earlier action was needed and would have saved many lives.'

Although the number of people who have died in the UK's outbreak is still rising and higher than in any other European country, the weekly deaths are now consistently coming down in hospitals.

This means the virus is at much lower levels in the community - there are thought to be somewhere between 100 and 1,000 infected people for every one person who dies.

Fewer deaths and infected patients are crucial for Britain's ability to move out of lockdown. It has now been 10 days since Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that people could spend as much time outdoors as they wanted.

And within the next 10 days the government will be expected to decide whether to further loosen restrictions from June 1.

In his public address on May 10, Mr Johnson suggested that if there were encouraging signs of a shrinking outbreak, the second phase of lockdown loosening could start on June 1.

This could include the partial reopening of some schools and non-essential shops, such as clothing stores or sports shops, which are currently required to stay closed. Social distancing will have to remain in place.

Today's sunny weather, however, has drawn thousands to beaches and beauty spots and triggered concerns that people are flouting social distancing rules and getting too close to strangers in public.

Government rules now allow people to travel to spend time outdoors at parks and beaches, and they can spend as long as they want outdoors, sunbathe and have picnics, as long as they stay away from people they don't live with.

Sunbathers made the most of their new-found freedom following the easing of lockdown restrictions as London's St James's Park saw a high of 79.16F (26.2C) on Tuesday – beating 2020's previous top temperature of 78.8F (26C) set last month.

The sunshine is set to continue for most of the UK on Wednesday, with the mercury expected to hit 82F (28C).

Pictures of residents and tourists flocking to beaches in Southend, Bournemouth, Margate and Brighton sparked backlash.

LBC's Charlotte Sullivan tweeted: 'More people arriving in Southend today. It almost looks like any other hot day here apart from the dots on the floor to mark out where to stand in the queue for ice creams.

'One man told me ""it’s madness, it’s like everyone’s forgotten about coronavirus”'.

Another social media user posted: 'The state of Southend beach today like that is ridiculous, how have people not been told to leave?'

A third added: 'Southend beach at lunchtime on what's heading for the hottest day of the year. Technically you're allowed to travel somewhere and to sunbathe - but this is the result when so many choose the same place...'

University College London researchers analysed 18 studies looking into the link between the viral disease and children.

They found the risk of catching COVID-19 in children and teenagers was 56 per cent lower compared to adults over 20.

The scientists say their findings imply children are likely to play a lesser role in transmission of the disease because fewer of them get infected in the first place.

Lead author Professor Russell Viner told a press conference ahead of the paper's publication today that the results show the 'balance of risks for children is strongly towards a return to school'.

The UCL team are the latest experts to throw their support behind Boris Johnson amid a furious row about English schools restarting in June.

Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter, from Cambridge University, also claims the risk for children catching COVID-19 is 'unbelievably low'.

Yet the PM has faced ferocious backlash from parents and teaching unions for his plan to get children in reception, year 1 and year 6 back to school on June 1.

Scores of councils have refused to reopen amid fears pupils will spread the virus between each other, their teachers teachers and families.

This is how social distanced desks will look at Holywell Village First School in Northumberland

In the largest study of its kind, UCL scientists analysed 6,000 international scientific papers looking into children's susceptibility to infection and severity of illness.

Of them, just 18 were found to be of high enough quality to be considered in their analysis - half of which had not been peer-reviewed (scrutinised by other scientists).

Nine were contact-tracing studies, where researchers tracked close contacts of diagnosed patients.

Eight were population-screening studies, whereby random samples of society were tested for the virus.

Leading Cambridge University expert says risk for children catching COVID-19 is 'unbelievably low' The risk of children catching coronavirus is 'unbelievably low', according to one of the UK's top experts. Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter said data has also shown that teachers do not have a greater risk of becoming infected. The University of Cambridge professor's testimony comes amid an explosive row over the reopening of schools next month. Professor Spiegelhalter pointed out that just one out of 7million children aged four to 14 in England and Wales has died from COVID-19. He also claimed children carry just a fraction of the viral load compared to adults, which significantly reduces their ability to fall ill or infect others. Professor Spiegelhalter told the BBC: 'There have been, based on the data so far, extremely low risks to children. Out of 7million five to 14-year-olds in England and Wales, so far the number of death certificates revealed with Covid on it is one. 'There will be more [that haven't been confirmed], but there is still an extremely low risk. Of course we must remember this group of kids are staggeringly safe in general, less than one in 10,000 die every year. Nobody’s ever been safer in the history of humanity than this group of kids.' Professor Spiegelhalter said that at least one child had died from a rare inflammatory illness linked to coronavirus, but reassured parents that the risk of the complication would now be 'much lower now the epidemic in the community is under control.' Asked about whether teachers and parents were being put at risk by schools reopening, the Cambridge professor said data suggested not. He added: 'The Office for National Statistics analysed Covid risks by occupation - some have higher risks, including bus drivers and care home workers.' But teachers were not included in this category, he said. 'Of course people are anxious about the rest of the family, but in healthy young parents aged between 20 and 40, there have only been about 30 death so far out of 30,000 who don’t have existing conditions. 'There's about a three in a million chance of risk of death. That's a measurable risk, but in a sense it's a manageable risk... it's not overwhelming at all.' Advertisement

And one was a systematic review of small household clusters, where entire families had been infected.

The analysis - yet to be published in a journal - showed that children and young people had 56 per cent lower odds of catching SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person, compared with adults over 20)

Researchers did not have sufficient data to examine whether children under 12 differed to teenagers in susceptibility.

Under-18s also appear to account for just one in 10 family clusters of the viral disease, although this was based on just one study so the evidence is weak.

While children appear less likely to catch the virus from others, once they are infected researchers remain uncertain about how likely children are to pass it on.

Lead author Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at UCL, said: 'There is an increasing amount of data now available on children and COVID-19, and this is the first comprehensive study to carefully review and summarise what we do and do not know about susceptibility and transmission.

'Our findings show children and young people appear 56 per cent less likely to contract COVID-19 from infected others.

'Susceptibility is a key part of the chain of infection, and this supports the view that children are likely to play a smaller role in transmitting the virus and proliferating the pandemic, although considerable uncertainty remains.

'This new data provides essential evidence to governments around the world to inform their decision-making on whether to reopen schools and reduce or end lockdown measures.'

Co-author Dr Rosalind Eggo, an infectious disease modeller at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'It [the study] suggests that children and young people are at lower risk of infection than adults and may therefore play a smaller role in the epidemic as a whole.

'This new evidence will help us better understand the possible effect of school reopening on transmission in schools and in the community.'

It comes after a report by the 'Independent SAGE' committee claimed it is not safe to reopen schools on June 1.

Sir David King - who chairs the 'Independent SAGE' committee and was Tony Blair's Chief Scientific Adviser when he was prime minister - said it is 'too soon' for children to return.

His alternative SAGE committee of experts says delaying schools reopening for two weeks would allow for the Government's 'test, trace and isolate' programme, including its delayed app, to be established.

In the first phase of his back-to-school blueprint, Boris Johnson wants children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1.

An expert on Downing Street's scientific advisory subcommittee on schools claimed that these specific year groups were selected based on worries for their education and wellbeing - not that they are more shielded to the disease.

Although age is a factor in how at-risk an infected person is to Covid-19 symptoms, modelling found there was 'no increased risk to one year group over another'.

The revelations that there is no difference in the vulnerability of certain year groups will likely whip up anger from teachers' unions, who claim social distancing is much harder to enforce in primary schools.",15,Low,Right

If up to half of the tests posted out to people had not been returned to a laboratory that could mean up to around 350,000 of them never completed the analysis - but they were counted anyway by the Government.

Officials claim to have carried out 1.5million tests in their 'Pillar 2' system - the mass-testing regime for the public - meaning that if 350,000 were never completed that would represent a fifth of all those tests.

Professor Newton, speaking in a grilling by MPs on Parliament's Science and Technology Committee this morning, said it had been the Department of Health's decision to count tests that had been posted rather than those completed.

The Department did not confirm the return rate of the home tests.

In the same tense meeting, Professor Newton and his colleague Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, said Britain abandoned mass testing in March because the country's outbreak was already too large.

'Many hundreds of thousands' of people had the virus after half-term, they admitted, and contact tracing 'could not possibly' have prevented the current disaster.

A revealing meeting with MPs on Parliament's Science and Technology also found:

The UK abandoned its South Korea-style testing and tracing approach in March because the outbreak exploded out of control and it would have been futile;

Public Health England has refused to give MPs some of the scientific papers it submitted to SAGE, despite repeated requests;

Conservative MP Greg Clark accused PHE of 'a degree of opacity of the basis on which decisions were made to pursue our testing strategy';

PHE passed the buck on various decisions, from that of stopping public testing, of refusing the help of private laboratories, and of how to count the number of tests - all these decisions, bosses said, were taken by the Department of Health;

Professor John Newton, PHE's testing tsar, urged members of the public not to buy antibody tests from Superdrug or any other private companies selling them;

The door is still open for possible 'immunity certificates' when scientists understand whether people are safe from re-infection after recovering;

PHE will continue to re-evaluate whether the 2m (6'6"") social distancing rule is the best approach, but stand by the decision to have it on a 'precautionary' basis for now, despite countries around the world shortening to 1m or 1.5m;

School reopenings should be taken on an individual basis, Professor Doyle said, with some schools ready earlier than others.

Professor Yvonne Doyle and Professor John Newton were today grilled by MPs and defended Publlic Health England's actions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, saying the Department of Health took the major decisions while PHE provided specialist advice

Matt Hancock's promise to test 100,000 people per day by the beginning of May would not have been met if the Department of Health had not counted tests that were posted

Home tests have been available since the end of April but Professor Newton said he didn't know how many people who ordered them were actually returning them to the labs.

When asked what the return rate was, Professor Newton hesitated at length before saying: 'Certainly more than half.'

GOVERNMENT'S TESTING CHIEF SAYS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BUY DIY ANTIBODY TESTING KITS The Government's testing coordinator has urged the public to wait for an approved home antibody testing kit rather than buying one off the internet. Professor John Newton told the Commons Science and Technology Committee the public should wait for an approved home test which is currently being evaluated. The Government announced on Thursday that more than 10 million antibody kits were being bought for use in hospitals and care homes. It comes after high street chains including Superdrug began to offer a home antibody test kit for £69. When asked about the new home tests, Professor Newton said better tests would be available to the public soon. He said: 'The public need to be aware that those tests are not the same as those we have evaluated and approved for use. 'The laboratory-based tests have a much higher standard of accuracy. We wouldn't recommend at the moment that people rely on the tests that are becoming widely available. 'My advice would be to wait until we have better tests which will be available in a similar form very soon, though they are still under evaluation at the moment.' Advertisement

Pressed again by Conservative MP Greg Clark, chair of the committee, Professor Newton added: 'I'm afraid I don't have that figure.'

The fact that up to 50 per cent of the tests may not be getting sent back to labs for analysis suggests that the number of tests the Government is claiming to do each day could be wildly over-estimated.

Professor Newton, defending PHE's involvement, said the Department of Health took the decision to count a test that had been posted.

Labour MP Graham Stringer asked what the definition of a test was and said: 'Clearly, posting a test is not a test.'

Professor Newton replied: 'The way tests are counted [was] discussed with officials at the Department of Health and we were advised by the officials in the Department of Health on the appropriate method of counting the tests and that's what we did.'

Greg Clark, the meeting's chair, cut in: 'They advised you, you didn't advise them?'

'No, they advised us, absolutely, yes,' Professor Newton said.

Mr Stringer asked with a raised eyebrow: 'Do you think it's appropriate? Counting posted letters as opposed to real tests?'

And Professor Newton replied: 'Well, I think the important thing is that they're only counted once.

'The basis on which we were advised that the decision had been made was that the test should be counted at the point where the programme had control of what happened, and that was the point at which the tests were sent out and made available for testing.

'The key thing is that a very large number of tests are now being conducted and, whichever way you count them, it's a large number of tests - it's a huge increase.'

In the meeting the PHE bosses also admitted that Britain had to abandon its South Korea-esque approach to testing and tracing infections in March because the UK's outbreak was simply too large.

South Korea has earned global acclaim for its policy of intensively testing and isolating everyone in the population suspected of having COVID-19.

TEST AND TRACE APPROACH STOPPED BECAUSE OUTBREAK WAS TOO LARGE IN UK The UK abandoned coronavirus testing in March because the outbreak was already out of control and hundreds of thousands of people were infected, officials have admitted. Public Health England bosses, who were grilled by MPs this morning, admitted that officials wanted to follow the strategy of South Korea to keep a lid on the pandemic. But shortly after the February there were 'many hundreds of thousands' of people infected with COVID-19 and trying to test them all would have been futile. At the time the Government was managing to test fewer than 2,000 people per day. As a result, directors at Public Health England said, it was 'not worthwhile' to continue trying to find and isolate every case of COVID-19 and officials. The chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, publicly announced on March 12 that the Government would no longer test anyone outside of hospitals. The Government has been heavily criticised for building its testing capacity too slowly, with experts saying better testing could have helped to contain the virus and save lives. Current testing efforts are on a much greater scale but PHE this morning revealed that huge numbers of people sent home testing kits are not returning them. The posted kits are counted as a test in the Government's much-heralded daily numbers, but Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE, could only say 'certainly more than half' of the tests are currently returned to the lab.

This means the cases there have been contained to relatively small areas and the number of them is extremely low (around 11,000 confirmed cases).

Britain had wanted to follow the same strategy but, by the time officials realised the virus was spreading in the UK, it was already too late.

Professor Doyle said today that 'mass contact tracing needed to cease in March'.

She explained: 'It was a decision that was come to because of the sheer scale of cases in the UK which had been introduced by multiple introductions, particularly after half term, from European countries we now know had large amounts of prevalence themselves.'

Professor Doyle is believed to be referring to Italy in this point - it was around half-term that the outbreak in the country's Alpine ski resorts took hold and rattled Britain's schools, many of which had sent pupils there on trips during the week off.

'So we had multiple introductions,' Professor Doyle added, 'with many hundreds of thousands of people in March who had now been exposed to this virus in this country.

'So contact tracing could not possibly have had the capacity to address that and, with the capacity of lab testing and our contact tracers, we felt the most important thing to do was to focus on where there was national concern, which was the capacity of the NHS, to accrue that testing.'

On March 12 Professor Chris Whitty announced that the Government was stopping testing of members of the public for COVID-19.

Until then, its policy was to test everyone suspected of having the virus if they had been to a country where cases had been confirmed.

But as the outbreak spiralled out of control, the Government decided to only test people who were in hospital as patients or staff.

That persisted until late April, when officials began to widen the criteria again.

He and and Professor Doyle were grilled by politicians on the committee, who accused PHE of being 'opaque' about decisions being made by Government.

Mr Clark said that documents promised to the committee weeks ago had still not been given to MPs, despite having been used to inform SAGE, which advises Downing Street.

In the meeting Professor Doyle repeatedly refused calls from Mr Clark to send them all of the documents that had informed the decision to stop mass testing and tracing.

Mr Clark said: 'A commitment was given to provide that assessment, that contemporary assessment, many weeks have gone by, it hasn't been provided.'

Professor Newton said some of the information was in the public domain in documents that were published on PHE's website.

TOP SCIENTIST TEARS INTO UK'S CRISIS RESPONSE A Nobel Prize-winning scientist tore into Boris Johnson's leadership during the coronavirus crisis today, claiming it was not clear 'who is actually in charge of the decisions'. Sir Paul Nurse said Britain has been left on the 'back foot' with a lack of clear planning that left it 'firefighting through successive crises', in a scathing attack on the political establishment. Sir Paul, the chief executive of the distinguished Francis Crick Institute, said the country had been 'increasingly playing catch-up' and scientists and politicians should lay out 'a much clearer publicly-presented strategy' to tackle the pandemic. Sir Paul's intervention came as the Government faces increasing pressure over its handling of the pandemic. Last night Mr Johnson was forced to u-turn over a widely unpopular decision to make foreign NHS and care staff pay a surcharge to access healthcare in the UK, while working to save British lives. Geneticist Sir Paul, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2001, told the BBC's Today Programme: 'I'm not completely convinced that we are actually being quite clear in having good leadership. 'The question I keep asking myself is: Do we have a proper Government system in here that can combine tentative knowledge, scientific knowledge, with political action? 'And the question I'm constantly asking myself is: Who is actually in charge of the decisions? Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy?'

He added that there had been a discussion in the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which established that it would ""not be worthwhile"" to continue contact tracing once community transmission took hold in the UK.

'There was discussion in fact with SAGE in February,' Professor Newton said, 'which established that when community transmission was established in the country that it would not be worthwhile to carry on with contact tracing, which is in fact the South Korean model.

'When in March it became apparent that community transmission was occurring and we had multiple injections, introductions from different countries in the UK that decision was then enacted.

'It was a decision of course of Government, informed by all its advisers not just Public Health England.'

In the meeting, Professor Newton said he does not recommend that people use the antibody tests which Superdrug has started selling.

The high street giant this week announced it was selling blood testing kits so people could find out if they have had the virus already and recovered.

The tests are made by the same company that is producing one of two tests approved by PHE for government use - Abbott - but they are being used differently.

Superdrug's service requires people to take their own blood sample at home and post it to a private laboratory, while the Government has only approved the tests for use by a healthcare professional.

Professor Newton said: 'The public needs to be aware that those tests are not the same as the tests that we have evaluated and approved for use.

'The laboratory-based tests do have a much higher standard of accuracy and we wouldn’t recommend, at the moment, that people rely on the tests which are widely available.

'My advice would be to wait until we have better tests which will be available in similar form relatively soon, although those are still under evaluation at the moment.'",15,Low,Right

Scientists are looking for 10,260 people from across Britain to take the experimental jab, developed at the University of Oxford.

Experts began working on the jab in January. It is now considered one of the front-runners in the world's race for a COVID-19 vaccine.

The vaccine, called AZD1222, proved safe in 160 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 55 as part of the first phase of the trial.

Phases II and III involve vastly increasing the number of volunteers while expanding the age range to include elderly people, who are most at-risk of falling seriously ill with the infection.

They will assess whether the vaccine provokes a response from the immune system before looking at whether it can prevent people becoming infected.

Pictured: The Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, where the research began in January

'The early stages of the Phase I trial have gone very well and we're grateful for the many volunteers from Southampton who have come forward to help us assess the safety of the new vaccine and if healthy people can be protected from Covid-19,' said Saul Faust, professor of paediatric immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Southampton.

'We would now very much like to invite people from the Southampton area whose work brings them into possible contact with Covid patients or who are healthy and in the older age groups to take part in the next stage of trials of this Oxford Covid vaccine.

WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO ROLL OUT A VACCINE? Developing a vaccine is a complex procedure which relies on a number of lengthy steps. But researchers racing to develop one for COVID-19 - which threatens to keep entire nations in lockdown until it can be stopped - are breaking through this stages at an unprecedented pace, scientists say. One vaccine for rotavirus, a virus that causes deadly diarrhoea in children, took 26 years to make, the Washington Post reported, and one of its creators called this 'pretty typical'. Scientists must first sequence the virus they want to make a vaccine against - meaning they deconstruct it to examine its internal workings. This process was sped up because the Chinese officials who discovered the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 mapped the virus and shared it worldwide for free at the very start of the outbreak. Scientists also noticed that it is almost identical to the one that causes SARS, a similar illness which hit Asia in 2002/3. This saved time because researchers already knew which areas of the virus they could target, and some had already tried to make SARS vaccines, which could work as a blueprint for tackling COVID-19. Trials, which begin after a vaccine is painstakingly designed and produced in a laboratory, also take a long time. First, scientists must repeatedly test the vaccine on animals such as mice or monkeys. If it proves to be safe, this must then go on to very small human trials, then incrementally larger ones as the safety and effectiveness of it is constantly monitored. Often, human trials take months or even years so scientists can be absolutely certain the vaccine won't have any damaging side effects. If there are any hiccups the researchers may have to tweak the chemical make-up of the vaccine and start again. If things go smoothly, the vaccine can progress to the manufacturing phase and be produced en masse and sold to the people or governments who need them. Scientists have claimed they could have a vaccine ready for COVID-19 by September this year, a break-neck pace which critics say is unlikely. Professor Robin Shattock, an immunity expert at Imperial College London, said: 'It’s highly unlikely that a vaccine will be available for use by September. 'It will be critical to build the evidence base to show a vaccine works before it’s deployed. This takes time and is dependent on seeing a difference in the number of infections between active vaccine and a placebo. 'The lower the transmission rate in the UK, the longer it will take to generate such data.' Advertisement

'This is one of only four vaccine trials underway worldwide and could pave the way for a vaccine to be delivered later this year.'

Initially, researchers are aiming to recruit up to 620 new volunteers in three categories:

250 people aged 18-55 who have come into contact, or possible contact, with Covid-19 patients due to their work, such as health and care workers, cleaners, and dentists

120 otherwise health people aged over 70

A further healthy group of 250 people aged at least 55

Researchers will assess the immune response to the vaccine in people of different ages, to determine how well the immune system responds in older people or children.

Adult participants in the phase II and phase III groups will be randomised to receive one or two doses of either a vaccine known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or a licensed vaccine (MenACWY) that will be used as a 'control' for comparison.

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees that has been genetically changed to make it impossible for it to grow in humans.

This has been combined with genes that make proteins from the Covid-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) which play a key role in the infection pathway of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Phase I involved healthy adult volunteers to check the vaccine was safe. Around 1,000 doses were given out.

Production of the vaccine has already been scaled up ahead of the trial to prepare as early as possible for potential future deployment, the University of Southampton said.

AstraZeneca said this week it had the capacity to manufacture one billion doses of the University of Oxford's potential Covid-19 vaccine and would begin supply in September.

The Brentford-based firm has signed a deal to mass-produce Oxford University's promising COVID-19 jab and has agreements to supply 400million doses already.

US health officials – who have spent $1billion (£806,000) on funding the vaccine – have ordered 300million doses and hope to receive them for October.

Britain has a deal for 100million doses 'as early as possible' and ministers last week revealed they hoped a third of those would be ready for September.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the Government is ambitiously hoping to be in a position to roll-out a mass vaccination programme in the autumn of this year.

But top scientists dealt a blow to the hopes of millions of Britons longing for an end to the pandemic when they warned a working vaccine is unlikely to be ready until 2021.

Doubts have been cast about the jab – one of the front-runners in the world's vaccine race – after studies on monkeys suggested it didn't stop them getting infected.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, now called AZD1222, is currently in trials on humans to prove it is safe and the team say it is progressing well.

Promising results that showed another experimental vaccine, made by US firm Moderna, could block the virus in humans sent stock markets into frenzy this week.

Oxford University's jab was known as ChAdOx1 nCoV but has now been called AZD1222

However, some scientists have warned that a vaccine might not be widely available until next year.

Professor Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, told the BBC he believes vaccines 'won't be readily available for widescale use until the beginning of next year as the kind of most optimistic estimation.'

He has said there are around 100 coronavirus vaccines in development around the world and it will take months to get enough data to prove one works.

The one being made by his team at Imperial is being developed at an extraordinary pace, he has said, but it would be a 'false expectation' to think it was nearly ready.

Early clinical trials are intended to prove only that a vaccine is safe, and further large-scale studies must be done afterwards to see if it actually protects against the disease.

Professor Shattock said on Monday: 'I think we need to distinguish two different things.

'One of the hurdles is making vaccine doses, obviously AstraZeneca can do that and that is a good thing but that is very different to having the data that proves that the vaccine actually works.

'We need to have those data to show that it is ready and appropriate to roll out. It may take quite some time to get that data, it is a numbers game.

'And in fact as we are better at reducing the number of infections in the UK it gets much harder to test whether the vaccine works or not.

'There are no certainties, no guarantees in developing any of these candidates so I think it is important not to have a false expectation that it is just around the corner.

'It may be longer than any of us would want to think.'",15,Low,Right

Dr Andrea Ammon urged the continent to prepare for another crisis, which she said was inevitable because so few people will have developed COVID-19 immunity.

Studies suggest less than 15 per cent of the population in Europe's worst-hit nations have already been infected, leaving the majority vulnerable in the future.

Dr Ammon warned the virus - scientifically known as SARS-CoV-2 - is not going away any time soon because it is 'very well adapted to humans'.

Top experts have warned against celebrating figures that show dwindling outbreaks across Europe because the battle is yet to be won.

Almost all scientists agree the infection is bound to re-emerge in a second wave in the absence of a vaccine or cure for the coronavirus.

The biggest fear is the second wave will occur during the winter and coincide with flu season, which could overwhelm already swamped hospitals.

Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, said another wave will be inevitable because so few people have immunity to the disease

Europe has become the centre of the coronavirus crisis, with more than 164,350 deaths and 1.74million cases (pictured). The UK has the most cases and deaths

Experts have warned against celebrating figures that show dwindling outbreaks across Europe because the battle is yet to be won. Pictured, how daily deaths have fallen in the UK

Dr Ammon, director of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said a second wave of the coronavirus is no longer a theory.

In an interview with The Guardian, she said: 'The question is when and how big, that is the question in my view.

'Looking at the characteristics of the virus, looking at what now emerges from the different countries in terms of population immunity – which isn’t all that exciting, between 2 per cent and 14 per cent, that leaves still 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the population susceptible.

ONLY 1% OF DANES HAVE HAD THE VIRUS Only 1 per cent of Danes have had the coronavirus, according to an antibody study, raising concerns that Denmark is vulnerable to another wave. Only 12 of 1,071 randomly selected Danes tested positive for antibodies in their blood - corresponding to a rate of about 1.1 per cent. The report was released by the Danish health agency SSI, a branch of the health ministry and responsible for the surveillance of infectious diseases. Experts interviewed by broadcaster DR said the results were concerning and showed the country was vulnerable to the spread of the virus picking up speed again. 'At the collective level we have no resilience, and that means there is a potential for epidemic spread again,' Jens Lundgren, professor of infectious diseases at one of Denmark's largest hospitals Rigshospitalet, told DR. SSI cautioned that the results were preliminary and there were several factors that made it difficult to say whether the results were indicative of the entire Danish population. They had only been able to carry out tests at five locations, meaning they had been limited to people living in those, or neighbouring, municipalities. 'Furthermore, whether the figures can be applied to the entire Danish population can also be affected by whether groups with different patterns of infection choose or not choose to accept the offer to be tested,' Steen Ethelberg at SSI said in a statement. Denmark on Wednesday reported a total of 11,117 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 554 deaths. Meanwhile, the parties of the country's parliament agreed on the next phase of opening up the country after an initial lockdown period. On April 15, the country started reopening pre-schools and resuming classes for the youngest primary school children - under strict social distancing and hygiene guidelines. Danish middle schools followed suit this week and with the deal struck on Wednesday, museums, movie theatres and zoos among other things would also soon reopen. Advertisement

'The virus is around us, circulating much more than [in] January and February… I don’t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it’s not the time now to completely relax.'

Europe has become the centre of the coronavirus crisis, with more than 164,350 deaths and 1.74million cases.

Dr Ammon believes holidaymakers returning from ski trips in early March contributed to the spread of the disease across the continent.

She also said the slow responses of governments across Europe cost lives, as a number of countries fumbled with putting lockdowns in place and banning foreign travel.

'I believe if we would have put in these measures earlier, it might have been possible [to save lives],' Dr Ammon said.

It follows a study yesterday which said triggering lockdown a week earlier could have saved the lives of more than 30,000 people in the UK.

At least 44,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the UK so far, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The UK reported only 363 hospital deaths yesterday, the lowest daily toll recorded on a Wednesday since the end of March.

Europe has seen its number of daily deaths dropping across the board for the past few weeks, figures show, after a peak in April.

Nations are cautiously emerging from lockdowns in order to restart the economy, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson planning for British schools to return on June 1.

This is based on the fact the virus is circulating less than it was before, indicated by the reproduction rate and lower number of new cases every day.

But the majority of Europeans are still susceptible to catching the virus, research suggests.

An estimated 12 per cent of people in England have caught the virus so far, according to results from a Government-led study.

It means 'herd immunity', when a virus is stamped out because most of the population has become immune to it, has not been established in any way.

Dr Ammon believes the battle with coronavirus will be a long haul.

'I don’t know whether it’s forever but I don’t think it will go away very quickly. It seems to be very well adapted to humans,' she said.

Figures show dwindling outbreaks across Europe - Spain, Italy, France and even the UK, all of which have been severely impacted by the deadly virus, are now showing positive signs of recovery.

But experts have warned against slacking virus defences now.

'TIME IS RUNNING OUT' TO GET CONTACT TRACING STARTED Ministers today admitted a crucial coronavirus smartphone app will not be ready by June 1 as NHS chiefs warned 'time is running out' to launch a track-and-trace system to avoid a second deadly wave. Security minister James Brokenshire said the software, which detects which users have been in contact with people who test positive for the disease, would be ready in the 'coming weeks'. But he insisted the contact tracing regime can still be in place by the hard deadline set by Boris Johnson, with plans to bring back schools, shops and businesses hanging in the balance as the economy goes into meltdown. But Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation - which represents organisations across the healthcare sector - warned the system was being put together 'very late in the day' and the draconian lockdown cannot be loosened without a 'clear implementation plan'. Mr Dickson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'm not saying it is impossible to do it, but I think there is concern among those at local level because we've seen - not occasionally, we've seen often - where national stuff is done with the best of intentions, but unless the local context is understood it doesn't really work as well as it should.' He added: 'And I think it is only recently, to be brutally honest, that the Government's rhetoric changed to recognise that to get this test, track and trace thing in place you not only need a national system, you not only need the app, but you also need to put at the centre of local plans local officials who understand about contact tracing - they do it all the time. 'But you need to co-ordinate that.' The new app has been tested on the Isle of Wight but its rollout has been delayed for weeks because of security flaws and it failed to work on all types of smartphone. Mr Brokenshire conceded the app will not be ready by June 1, telling Sky News it 'will be introduced in the coming weeks in parallel' with the system employing track and trace staff.

Dr Ammon said now it 'now is not the time to relax', following the thoughts of Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, who said this week it's time for 'preparation, not celebration'.

Dr Kluge is very concerned' a surge in infections would coincide with other seasonal diseases such as the flu.

Speaking exclusively to The Telegraph, he said countries should use this time wisely to learn from the first wave of infection and start to strengthen public health systems.

This could mean building capacity in hospitals, primary care and intensive care units, he said.

'Singapore and Japan understood early on that this is not a time for celebration, it's a time for preparation,' Dr Kluge said.

'That's what Scandinavian countries are doing – they don't exclude a second wave, but they hope it will be localised and they can jump on it quickly.'

Dr Kluge said: 'I’m very concerned about a double wave – in the fall, we could have a second wave of Covid and another one of seasonal flu or measles.'

It's not clear yet if the coronavirus is 'endemic', meaning it circulate at equal levels all year round, or seasonal, peaking in colder, winter months.

Other coronaviruses such as the common cold have been found to sharply increase in the winter months.

Other experts who have warned a re-appearance of the virus in the winter - as a result of seasonality or lifting the lockdown - could be disastrous for the NHS.

A second peak which overwhelms the NHS is considered the 'biggest threat to life' in the UK. That's according to the Government's 50-page 'roadmap' to ease lockdown.

The document detailed how Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to get Britain back to normality while minimising the risk of straining the NHS.

To avoid a second deadly wave, the Government plans to use contact tracing, whereby anyone who has been close to a confirmed COVID-19 case is tested or isolated.

Called 'test, track, trace', it was abandoned on March 12 because cases spiralled out of control - but not without criticism.

Ministers are hoping to get the system up and running by June 1. But 'time is running' out, NHS chiefs warn, with only 10 days to fine-tune the programme.

The PM has hailed a 25,000-strong army of trackers recruited to identify the contacts of infected victims and prevent outbreaks. Similar schemes have controlled outbreaks in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan.

But Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation - which represents organisations across the healthcare sector - warned the system was being put together 'very late in the day', and training for call-handlers has not been comprehensive.

Hundreds of thousands of frontline health workers will be offered the tests, which detect if someone has ever been infected with the disease.

Roche's blood test looks for antibodies, substances produced by the immune system in response to COVID-19.

With most viral infections, the presence of antibodies reduces or removes the risk of reinfection, but this has not yet been proven with coronavirus.

Experts say positive tests should not simply be seen as a 'green light' to reduce PPE or other protections for staff.

The Roche test, called Elecsys (pictured), produces results in a laboratory and is said to be 100 per cent accurate

WHY IS ANTIBODY TESTING IMPORTANT? WHAT IS AN ANTIBODY TEST? Unlike tests to diagnose diseases, antibody tests show who has been infected and recovered. The body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses and infections, including other coronaviruses. New blood tests are being developed to identify antibodies unique to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. The tests look for two kinds of antibodies: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG). The body quickly produces IgM antibodies for its initial attack against infections. It makes IgG antibodies more slowly and retains them longer; IgG antibodies suggest possible immunity. HOW CAN ANTIBODY TESTS HELP END LOCKDOWNS? Antibody tests can help calculate what portion of the population has already been infected, as well as whether infections were mild or severe. Governments and companies could use antibody tests to determine who would most likely be safe to return to work and public interactions, and whether it is safe to lift stay-at-home orders all at once in some regions or in stages based on infection risk. People with negative antibody tests or very low antibody levels would likely have higher risk of infection than people with high antibody levels. DO ANTIBODIES TO THE NEW CORONAVIRUS CONFER IMMUNITY? While antibodies to many infectious diseases typically confer some level of immunity, whether that is the case with this unique coronavirus is not yet known. And how strong immunity might be, or how long it might last in people previously infected, is not clear. With some diseases like measles the immunity can be lifelong. With others, immunity can wane over time. Scientists cannot know with certainty that reinfection is not possible until further research. Antibody tests could inform not just lockdown exits, but the best approach to treatments and vaccines. Advertisement

Ministers have been in talks with Roche to buy millions of the kits and Matt Hancock is expected to reveal later today what kind of deal has been struck.

It follows England's deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, promising last week the tests would be rolled out 'rapidly'.

Priority will be given to frontline hospital staff in coronavirus specific wards, as well as ICU and A&E departments.

These staff members will be monitored by scientists to see whether they fall ill again and paint a clearer picture of the protection antibodies provide.

But it is not clear how they will reach NHS workers or the public in the future.

Known as the 'have you had it' tests, antibody tests reveal whether someone has been infected with COVID-19 in the past and recovered from it.

But it's still not clear whether this means a person is protected from catching the virus again, therefore some scientists say antibody tests have limited value.

Dr Claudia Paoloni, president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, urged caution to those who test positive for antibodies.

She told The Guardian: 'As we learn more about the role of antibodies, this could open the door to different ways of working and reduce the level of risk to NHS staff by allocating those who have had the virus to care for Covid-19 patients.

'But we must be clear that huge uncertainties remain while we do not know the level and length of any immunity which antibodies will offer.

'The new test’s arrival should not simply be seen as a green light to reduce PPE and other protections for NHS staff who test positive.'

The Roche test, which is called Elecsys, was given the seal of approval by Public Health England on 14 May after scientists at its Porton Down facility evaluated how reliable it was.

PHE said the test is 'a very positive development' and that assessments found it was 'highly specific'.

According to Roche, their COVID-19 antibody test has 'a specificity greater than 99.8 per cent and a sensitivity of 100 per cent' - as long as it is used at least 14 days after someone has developed symptoms.

The Roche test has a 'specificity' of 99.8 per cent, meaning it generates very few 'false positives' - when it indicates someone has been infected when they have not.

For every thousand people who take the test only two will be given a false positive result, according to its claim.

Sensitivity is the rate of all positive samples that are truly positive. A rate of 100 per cent suggests very few, potentially zero, will get an inaccurate result - known as a false negative result.

Sensitivity is considered the area authorities can afford to compromise on - not specificity.

False positives, caused by poor specificity, may lead people to believe they are immune when they're not, causing their behaviour to become riskier, or to receive treatment that they don't need.

Roche said the amount of tests it would be able to make each month for the US and countries accepting the CE mark would be in the 'high double-digit millions'. Pictured: Prime Minister of Bavaria holding the Elecsys test on May 4

The FDA gave the Roche test the green light on May 3, allowing laboratories across the US to use it even though it has yet to be formally approved.

German officials already signed a deal at the beginning of May to buy five million of the Roche kits every month.

Roche said the amount of tests it would be able to make each month for the US and countries accepting the CE mark would be in the 'high double-digit millions'.

But neither Roche nor the Government has revealed how much the antibody test will cost to purchase in bulk at this stage.

It is not designed to give people a result in the comfort of their own home - referred to as the 'pregnancy test' style kits.

The test requires blood samples to be taken by trained health professionals, and then it will be processed by machines already used in NHS labs across the country. Medics can get results in just 18 minutes.

Experts say the fact the test needs to be sent off to a laboratory is a limitation of the test because it could lead to delays in results.

'It will be important to understand how widespread this equipment is and how testing could be organised regionally and locally to provide a rapid and high throughput system,' said Dr Colin Butter, an associate professor and programme leader in bioveterinary science, University of Lincoln.

The Government's track record for testing has been abysmal so far. The UK tests fewer people per capita than most European countries.

Experts blame this on PHE's 'control freakery' in reluctance to involve private labs that offered to help process tests. The agency has denied this.

Roche is not the only test the Government are in negotiations with. It is believed deals are also being worked up with US firm Abbott and Welsh company Ortho Clinical Diagnostics.

The Welsh firm's test is the only UK-validated device which is manufactured in Britain. Roche and Abbott both produce their devices overseas, which can cause delays in the supply chain.

They are the first antibody tests to be ratified as accurate by PHE. The body does not 'approve' tests, just evaluate how good they are.

As well as detecting which healthcare staff have previously been infected, antibody tests are considered key to easing lockdown.

They are able to paint the clearest picture about how widespread COVID-19 is in the community by seeing how many individuals have already had the disease.

The true size of Britain's outbreak is a mystery because health chiefs abandoned a mass antigen-testing regime early on in the crisis.

PHE is conducting a surveillance programme to understand how many of the population have had the virus using their own, high accuracy antibody test operated at their Porton Down science campus.

Results have not been published yet but suggest that less than 10 per cent of people in the UK have antibodies, with more in London than rural areas.

All three antibody tests approved by ministers are laboratory-based and can take up to a day to produce results.

No home 'pregnancy-test' kits that can be done in the comfort of someone's own home and without processing by a lab, have yet been approved.

That's despite promises in March that one would be available and ministers buying millions of pounds worth of commercial tests from overseas.

None of them have met the high accuracy standards set out by PHE after an Oxford University trial found they returned inaccurate results.

The failure was a significant setback because it had been hoped the antibody tests would be the route out of lockdown.

However, versions of Abbott's test have been launched on various websites for a fee of £69 - £100.

Superdrug were the first high-street retailer to launch Abbott's antibody test for £69, which sold out within hours with Brits eager to find out if they have any kind of immunity.

It is not a 'home testing' kit because the blood sample, which a person collects in their home, has to be sent to a laboratory.

But medical giant Abbott, which makes Superdrug's tests, has insisted that its tests were not intended to be used by people taking their own blood samples.

Instead, the Illinois-based firm says its tests have only been evaluated to be accurate on blood samples taken by trained healthcare providers directly from patients' veins.

Commenting on the launch, scientists said they would not buy the tests themselves because the results are meaningless.

Even if the results return as positive, they may be inaccurate and there is no proof the person has immunity and therefore return to work.

The idea of ‘immunity certificates’ has been shelved for now because of this, although No 10 said it was still exploring the idea.

How accurate is Roche's newly-approved antibody test and will it show you if you are immune?

Here, MailOnline reveals everything you need to know about Roche's antibody test, from how accurate it is to how it will be used in the UK.

HOW WILL IT BE USED IN THE UK?

The kits are lab-based tests and require blood samples to be taken by trained health professionals.

The blood sample kit can be processed by machines already used in NHS labs across the country. Medics can get results in just 18 minutes.

Health minister Edward Argar said the tests would mainly be given to NHS and social care workers to start with.

Insiders say it is also likely to play a role in the government's 'surveillance' schemes, which will help track how far the virus has spread in Britain.

Ministers are currently clueless about the true size of Britain's outbreak because health chiefs abandoned a mass-testing regime early on in the crisis.

One of the current antibody schemes already underway has seen nurses take blood samples from a thousand households.

Early results - not yet published by officials - suggested up to four per cent of Britain has developed antibodies to the coronavirus.

CAN I USE THE ROCHE TEST MYSELF?

The Roche test, which is called Elecsys, is simply not designed to give people a result in the comfort of their own home.

Ministers have promised 'pregnancy-test' style kits, which would see Brits take their own blood sample and get a result in as little as 10 minutes.

But no DIY test - scientifically called an immunoassay - has yet to be approved by officials despite promises one would be available back in March.

One firm - awarded millions of pounds by the government to produce home-testing kits - hopes to have its product ready by the start of June.

Mologic's serology test will be available for Britons to purchase online, from retailers such as Boots and Amazon, according to reports.

It has not yet been approved by the Bedfordshire-based company is in 'urgent talks' with ministers to fast-track approval, The Telegraph says.

HOW MUCH WILL THEY COST THE GOVERNMENT?

Roche - which plans to produce millions of the kits each month - has not revealed how much the antibody test will cost to purchase in bulk.

Britain did, however, pay two Chinese firms around £16million for 2million antibody tests that failed strict accuracy tests - suggesting each kit cost around £8.

No details of any deals struck between Roche - based in Basel - and other countries have been made public.

This means it is not known whether Britain will pay more or less than other nations desperately seeking the antibody tests as draconian lockdowns are eased.

Roche - which operates two offices in Britain - has not revealed if it will manufacture the tests in the UK. The firm says it has 'extensive global manufacturing capabilities' to meet demand.

Following the announcement today, shares for Roche rose slightly to 44.95, the highest in several weeks, according to Yahoo! Finance

THE TIMELINE OF UK'S ANTIBODY TESTING DEVELOPMENTS March 25: Professor Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at PHE, told MPs antibody kits would be ready within days. But confusion was sparked when chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told revealed the tests would not be ready to buy online within days. March 26: Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, told MPs she expected home antibody tests to be available within a 'couple of weeks'. April 1: In the Downing Street press conference, Professor Doyle disputed the claim that PHE was 'dragging its feet' in approving antibody tests. She said: 'The important thing about theses antibody tests, this is not a matter of dragging our feet, it’s important that the test is valid, that it does what it says it does.' April 6: Sir John Bell, one of the Oxford University team evaluating antibody tests for the government, revealed none of them performed well. April 17: The New York Times reported that Britain was seeking a £16million refund after two antibody tests it had bought from Chinese companies were not accurate enough to be rolled out. April 21: University of Oxford experts published anonymised results of the nine tests the government had bought - they showed all were deemed too weak to use. Their sensitivity – ability to correctly spot people who had had the disease - ranged from 70 per cent to just 55 per cent. May 3: US regulators gave the 'game-changing' antibody test made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche the green light. May 4: German health bosses announce a deal with Roche to buy 3million of its kits in May, as well as 5million per month from June. May 13: Public Health England follows suit, approving the test to be used. It was revealed that health chiefs were planning to buy millions.

WILL PRIVATE FIRMS BE ABLE TO BUY THE TESTS?

Officials have yet to come forward with a concrete plan about how the tests will be used, or whether private firms will be able to buy them.

Many companies keen to restart operations want to use antibody testing kits to work out how much of their staff may be immune to the virus.

Insiders say it is unlikely the Roche tests will be available to purchase privately, at least initially.

This is because officials wouldn't be able to access the data they desperately need to plot the spread of the virus.

It remains unclear exactly how much the lab-based tests could cost, if and when they can be purchased.

WHO ELSE HAS APPROVED THE ROCHE ANTIBODY TEST?

Roche first announced it was developing the antibody on April 17, revealing it had plans to put it on the market in early May.

At the time, it announced it was working the US health regulator the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an 'emergency use authorisation'.

The FDA gave it the green light on May 3, allowing laboratories across the US to use it even though it has yet to be formally approved.

Roche also announced that the blood sample kit was also granted the vital 'CE mark' that shows it is safe to use within the EU.

German officials already signed a deal at the beginning of May to buy five million of the Roche kits every month.

Roche said the amount of tests it would be able to make each month for the US and countries accepting the CE mark would be in the 'high double-digit millions'.

SO WHY HAS IT TAKEN THE UK SO LONG TO APPROVE ANY TEST?

Sir John Bell, an immunologist at Oxford University involved in evaluating antibody kits for the government, admitted approving tests takes 'longer than it should'.

He suggested officials wanted to be completely sure that the tests were accurate, telling BBC Radio 4 Today's programme: 'I think you have to be a bit cautious.'

Sir John accepted it has 'taken a week or two longer than it might have', while other experts have said 'every day counts' amid a pandemic.

But he pointed out the failure of DIY antibody tests, which were described as 'terrific' and offered hopes of a way out of lockdown - but none turned out to work.

Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: 'In the grand scheme of things, 11 days would be nothing.'

But he added that 'when you are in a situation like this when every day counts, it is indeed concerning'.

HOW ACCURATE IS THE TEST?

As long as it is used at least 14 days after someone has developed symptoms, it has a 100 per cent sensitivity rate, Roche claims.

Sensitivity is the rate of all positive samples that are truly positive. For example, if a test has an accuracy rate of 99 per cent, it means 99 out of every 100 people who test positive have actually been infected.

The other one person, however, would have been given an inaccurate result - known as a false negative result.

The Roche test also has a 'specificity' of 99.8 per cent, meaning it generates very few 'false positives' - when it indicates someone has been infected when they have not.

For every thousand people who take the test only two will be given a false positive result, according to its claim.

Sensitivity is considered the area authorities can afford to compromise on because testing errors in that area lead to false negatives – people being told they haven't had the disease when they actually have – which would lead to relatively few consequences for most.

False positives, however, caused by poor specificity, may lead people to believe they are immune when they're not, causing their behaviour to become riskier, or to receive treatment that they don't need.

HOW COME THIS ONE WORKS WHEN OTHERS HAVE FAILED?

Roche scientists have managed to develop a test that only picks up the virus that causes COVID-19, scientifically known as SARS-CoV-2.

Previous tests assessed struggled to differentiate COVID-19 antibodies from four other types of human coronaviruses which cause the common cold.

The body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses and infections, including other coronaviruses.

But independent experts have also called for transparency over the results, which haven't been made publicly available.

Professor Carl Heneghan, from Oxford University, said: 'Without seeing the study methods and the data it's impossible to verify these claims of accuracy.'

Professor Sheila Bird, a bio-statistician at Cambridge University, also called on the government to reveal the study design to allow scientists to scrutinise the work.",15,Low,Right

Researchers at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta looked at 400 cannabis strains and focused on about a dozen that showed promise in preventing the virus from 'hijacking' our cells.

They say extracts of cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychoactive component of pot - helped lower the number of cell receptors available for coronavirus to attach to by more than 70 percent.

However, the team says people should not rush out and by cannabis products and that clinical trials are needed to confirm the results.

They studied how extracts high in CBD, the main nonpsychoactive ingredient in, interacted with receptors coronavirus uses to attack cells. Pictured: A nurse suctions the lungs of a COVID-19 patient at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers, NY, April 20

For the study, published in the pre-peer reviewed journal Preprints, the scientists partnered with Pathway Rx, a cannabis therapy research company, and Swysh Inc, a cannabinoid-based research company.

The team created artificial 3D human models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues with a sample of high CBD extracts from Cannabis Sativa plants.

The extracts were low in THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.

Next, researchers tested the effect the extracts had on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptors required for the virus to enter human cells.

Results showed that the extracts helped reduce the number of receptors that are the 'gateway' for the coronavirus to 'hijack' host cells.

The team, led by Dr Igor Kovalchuk (pictured) found the extracts lowered the number of receptors the virus uses to infects cells and multiply by more than 70%

'A number of them have reduced the number of [virus] receptors by 73 percent, the chance of it getting in is much lower,' lead researchers Dr Igor Kovalchuk, CEO of Pathway Rx, told The Calgary Herald.

'If they can reduce the number of receptors, there's much less chance of getting infected.'

They also looked at other receptors such as TMPRSS2, which allows the virus to invade cells more easily and multiply quickly.

'Imagine a cell being a large building,' Kovalchuk told CTV News.

'Cannabinoids decrease the number of doors in the building by, say, 70 percent, so it means the level of entry will be restricted. So, therefore, you have more chance to fight it.'

However, the team says this does not mean that people should go out and buy marijuana products as prophylactics.

Cannabis and CBD products that are currently on the market are not designed to treat or prevent infection from COVID-19. Therefore, clinical trials are needed.

'Given the current dire and rapidly developing epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue needs to be considered,' Kovalchuk said in an April press release.

'Our research team is actively pursuing partnerships to conduct clinical trials.'

If trials proves to be successful, he says the CBD strains may be used as mouth wash, gargle, inhalants or gel caps,

'It would be cheaper for people and have a lot less side-effects,' Kovalchuk told The Herald.",15,Low,Right

But most probably haven't, research from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai in New York city suggests.

Scientists there recruited more than 1,300 people from city who'd either tested positive for coronavirus or suspected they'd had it, but hadn't been tested.

Of 719 people who thought they'd had it, 37 percent tested negative for both the virus and antibodies they might have produced had they previously been infected.

'That does imply that likely many of the people who suspect that they had this probably didn't have it,' study co-author Dr Ania Wajnberg.

And assuming that they have had coronavirus and thus developed antibodies that might protect them against reinfection - an immunity that is still uncertain - might put people at greater risk of foregoing social distancing and exposing themselves to the virus in the first place.

Many Americans believe they've had coronavirus - but antibody testing of New York City residents who suspected they'd been infected revealed only 37% had antibodies that might protect them against reinfection (file)

As of Wednesday, more than 1.57 million Americans have tested positive for coronavirus.

That means that that less than 0.5 percent of the US population has had coronavirus

Yet, a third of Americans think they may have had it, suggests a recent Business Insider poll.

Estimates from most epidemiological models and antibody testing initiatives suggest the real number of infections falls somewhere in the gaping space between those two figures.

So far in New York City - the pandemic's epicenter - about one in five people tested have antibodies against coronavirus, indicating they've been infected already.

University of Southern California's latest antibody testing study suggests that somewhere between 2.5 and seven percent of Angelinos have caught coronavirus.

In Boston, 10 percent of residents tested for antibodies had them, as did 4.4 percent of people in France.

US officials have even considered using antibody testing as the basis of 'immunity passports,' and the UK and Germany have made moves to implement the documentation showing that people have tested positive for antibodies against the virus and may be immune to reinfection to help reopen societies.

At the moment, even if someone does test positive for antibodies, we don't yet know what level of protection that provides, or how long it might last.

And people resuming normal life on the basis of the assumption that they've had coronavirus and have antibodies that will protect them (also an unproven assumption) is even more dangerous.

For their antibody testing study, the Mt Sinai team recruited 1,343 people.

Of those, 624 had been diagnosed with coronavirus, confirmed by gold standard PCR swab tests.

The other 719 suspected they had coronavirus because they'd had symptoms, had been living with someone with a confirmed diagnosis, were told by a doctor they had the virus or were healthcare workers.

Most did not have antibodies to suggest they'd been infected.

Only 36 percent developed IgG antibodies - the kind that confers more lasting immunity - to SARS-CoV-1, which causes COVID-19, and 37 percent were negative for both antibodies and current infection.

'This finding suggests that a majority of participants suspected of having Covid-19 actually were not infected with SARS-CoV-2,' the study authors wrote.

'However, it may also include a false negative rate of our assay (which has a 92 percent sensitivity) or insufficient time for participants to mount an IgG antibody response.'

Encouragingly, nearly everyone who was diagnosed with a coronavirus did in fact develop antibodies, suggesting most people will gain some degree of protection after recovery.",15,Low,Right

The tests, which are intended to tell someone if they have had the virus in the past, cost £69 and require the user to take blood samples themselves and post them off to a laboratory, where it takes 24 hours to produce a result.

In a notice on the shop's website this afternoon it said: 'Due to the high demand of orders, this service is currently not available'.

And the medical giant Abbott, which makes the tests, has insisted that its tests were not intended to be used by people taking their own blood samples.

Instead, the Illinois-based firm says its tests have only been evaluated to be accurate on blood samples taken by trained healthcare providers directly from patients' veins.

Any test that has a CE mark – such as the one made by Abbott – can be legally sold and used in the UK but health chiefs have repeatedly urged Britons to avoid tests that haven’t been approved.

Officials last week approved the Abbott test for laboratory use, making it only the second kit of its kind to be given the green-light following a similar kit made by Swiss giant Roche.

No home ‘pregnancy-test’ kits have yet been approved, despite promises in March that one would be available.

Known as the 'have you had it' tests, antibody tests reveal whether someone has been infected with COVID-19 in the past and recovered from it, but scientists are still unsure whether this means they are protected from catching the virus again.

Therefore, some say there is 'no point' paying for a test because it is still not clear what the results mean.

Superdrug urges individuals to continue social distancing and following government guidance even if their result is positive.

Superdrug has become the first high street retailer to sell a coronavirus antibody test to the public for £69 with almost 100 per cent accuracy

A notice on Superdrug's website this afternoon said 'Due to the high demand of orders, this service is currently not available'

The test is produced by medical giant Abbott and has been given the seal of approval by Public Health England

Superdrug started selling the kit this morning on its Online Doctor service for £69, but said it isn't available in store.

It requires a few drops of blood collected by a finger prick taken at home which are sent off in a pre-paid envelope to The Doctors Laboratory. Blood is then placed into a vial, which must be filled until a certain level.

Michael Henry, Superdrug's healthcare director, said he is 'confident' the test is accurate and reliable.

It was the second antibody test to be approved by the government's testing chiefs and is soon expected to be used by professionals in the NHS and in public surveys.

The first was that manufactured by Swiss firm Roche, called Elecsys, which is also not designed to give people a result in the comfort of their own home.

Both tests have been described as 'game changing' by PHE which conducted an analysis of it.

Ministers are in talks with Roche to buy millions of the tests, which will be given to NHS and social care workers for free. It is not clear if they will ever be given to the public.

WHAT ANTIBODY TESTS ARE APPROVED SO FAR? Antibody tests made by Abbott and Roche are the first antibody tests to be ratified as accurate by Public Health England, after weeks of disappointments. The tests detect whether someone has had the virus and then recovered – which could indicate they may be immune. PHE said the ratification of the two tests performed in its labs was a ‘very positive development’. Both are likely to be used in the ‘test, track and trace’ programme being launched next week, in which anyone who has been in contact with a coronavirus patient will be tested. The Department of Health is in conversations with both firms about incorporating the kits into its testing programme, with NHS staff likely to be first to get access. The Abbott test is also being sold privately for home use by health tech firm Babylon and retailer Superdrug for £69. Home use of the test – which uses a spot of blood from a finger prick rather than a full blood sample – has only been confirmed as accurate by an independent lab, and not yet by PHE. Scientists have stressed that although the two tests offer useful information about who has been infected, it is not yet clear what proportion of these people will be immune to the disease. The idea of ‘immunity certificates’ has been shelved for now because of this, although No 10 said it was still exploring it. Hopes have run high since March that antibody tests could allow employees to return to work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock ordered 3.5million tests but it turned out the best of them could spot only 70 per cent of those who had been infected. The new tests resolve that problem by using proven lab-based technology, rather than the ‘pregnancy-test’ style kits Mr Hancock had pinned his hopes on. They also generate very few ‘false positives’ – which means indicating someone has been infected when they have not. Advertisement

Abbott's antibody kits are on standby for NHS use and a spokesperson said last week the firm had capacity to provide five million tests a month to the UK ‘with immediate effect’.

But anyone over the age of 18 can now privately buy the Abbott test on Superdrug, so long as they do not currently have symptoms of the virus because it takes at least 14 days for antibodies to be made.

Babylon is selling it for the same price, while another Northampton-based company – checkmybodyhealth.co.uk – is offering the Abbott test for £89. London-based privatecoronavirustests.com is selling it for £99.

The test is 97.5 per cent sensitive, which means just over 97 people in 100 who test positive have indeed been infected.

The other three people, however, would get an inaccurate result - known as a false negative result. They will be told they do not have antibodies when in fact they do.

The test has 100 per cent specificity, which means it will never generate a 'false positive' result - when people are incorrectly led to believe they have antibodies.

Experts say is it better to compromise on sensitivity than specificity, because 'false negatives' can have dangerous consequences.

However, commenting on the test, Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: 'This seems rather a strong claim since to be absolutely sure (“never”), an infinite number of people will have to have been tested.'

Will Irving, a professor of Virology, University of Nottingham, said although it is reassuring claims test to be very accurate, it depends entirely on how the company came to that conclusion.

He said: 'The sensitivity data will be dependent on what kind of serum samples have been tested. If these are mostly – or all – from hospitalised patients, then the figure may be an overestimate, as there are data suggesting that individuals who don’t become very ill with COVID-19 may not make very high levels of antibody.

'The same is true of specificity.'

PHE tested 96 blood samples from COVID-19 patients and 759 negative samples for its evaluation of Abbott's test.

But Superdrug has not disclosed how many samples its evaluations were based on from research at The Doctors Laboratory, a UKAS-accredited lab.

It's also not clear if its accuracy was measured with people taking blood samples themselves - as they would do at home - or by a medical professional.

Superdrug doctor ambassador, Dr Zoe Williams, made clear the new test does not confirm someone is safe to go back to work or mingle in society.

She said: 'There are however things to consider before taking it.

'Receiving a positive antibody test result does not confer immunity, and it is important that people understand a positive test result does not mean you can be any more relaxed with the required hygiene and social distancing measures as set out by the government.'

Ministers are in talks with Roche to buy millions of the tests, which will be given to NHS and social care workers for free. The Roche test, called Elecsys (pictured), is also not designed to give people a result in the comfort of their own home.

Medical giant Abbott has produced a test which is essentially the same as the antibody test announced by the Government last week, manufactured by Swiss firm Roche.

Scientists welcomed the development in antibody testing. But rallied to remind the public that various antibody tests being sold privately online are a gamble, even if approved by officials.

WHY IS ANTIBODY TESTING IMPORTANT? WHAT IS AN ANTIBODY TEST? Unlike tests to diagnose diseases, antibody tests show who has been infected and recovered. The body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses and infections, including other coronaviruses. New blood tests are being developed to identify antibodies unique to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. The tests look for two kinds of antibodies: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG). The body quickly produces IgM antibodies for its initial attack against infections. It makes IgG antibodies more slowly and retains them longer; IgG antibodies suggest possible immunity. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RAPID TESTS AND ASSAYS? Some companies are developing finger-prick tests that get results in minutes. These are called immunoassays and will form the basis of home testing kits. Others are developing far more accurate tests called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that require sending blood samples to a lab for analysis. HOW CAN ANTIBODY TESTS HELP END LOCKDOWNS? Antibody tests can help calculate what portion of the population has already been infected, as well as whether infections were mild or severe. Governments and companies could use antibody tests to determine who would most likely be safe to return to work and public interactions, and whether it is safe to lift stay-at-home orders all at once in some regions or in stages based on infection risk. People with negative antibody tests or very low antibody levels would likely have higher risk of infection than people with high antibody levels. DO ANTIBODIES TO THE NEW CORONAVIRUS CONFER IMMUNITY? While antibodies to many infectious diseases typically confer some level of immunity, whether that is the case with this unique coronavirus is not yet known. And how strong immunity might be, or how long it might last in people previously infected, is not clear. With some diseases like measles the immunity can be lifelong. With others, immunity can wane over time. Scientists cannot know with certainty that reinfection is not possible until further research. Antibody tests could inform not just lockdown exits, but the best approach to treatments and vaccines.

Professor Gino Martini, Royal Pharmaceutical Society Chief Scientific Officer, said: 'Any antibody test at present can only provide a partial picture.

'The real issue is that no-one knows the level of immunity that is conferred by having antibodies to coronavirus, how long it might last, and if you can become re-infected.

'We need much more information and data on immunity before we can understand the importance of having antibodies to the virus.'

Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics, University of Bristol, said: 'Even a true positive result, showing real antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, may not mean that a person is completely immune to the infection and at no risk of re-infection and of infecting others.

'We hope that immunity following previous infection will be fully protective in this way, but we are not yet sure.

'All of this complicated information is important.'

Professor Finn, who is also in the field of developing an antibody test for COVID-19, said until the science is clear, there is no point spending money on an antibody test.

'Until we know how strong and long lasting immunity is after infection, it is hard to know what to do about the results of these tests, even if the tests are reliable,' he said.

'So the bottom line is: don't spend money and time on any test unless you have a very clear idea of what the result does or does not mean for you and what you are going to do or not do if you get a positive or negative result.

'If the answer is that the result is not going to change what you do because you can't be sure what it means, then there's no point in doing the test.'

Babylon’s Dr Olivia Morrow – who is helping to lead the company’s coronavirus testing effort – says an antibody test 'can help give answers to people who are unsettled, wondering if that cough, fever, or loss of smell they had in February was COVID-19'.

Users can also choose to opt-in to share information to aid national research by institutions such as PHE, according to the company. It's not clear if this is the case for Superdrug.

PHE is conducting a surveillance programme to understand how many of the population have had the virus using their own, high accuracy antibody test operated at their Porton Down science campus.

Millions of Abbott's lab-based tests have been shipped to customers across the US after it was granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA.

Abbott plans to ramp up to 20million antibody tests in June and beyond.

It's hoped that one day, CE-marked home testing kits, also called lateral flow tests, will become available.

But they have to be proven to work, first. Health chiefs are still on the hunt for an accurate immunoassay test since ministers promised one back in March.

The finger-prick test generates results in minutes at home. The results are displayed like a pregnancy stick and don't need the help of a laboratory of doctor.

Such a test was touted as the key to lifting lockdowns because it would mean people could buy a test quickly online, find out if they have had the virus and return to work or not.

But progress has been halted because scientists have warned it's still to early for them to know what the antibodies show, exactly.

There are hundreds of companies designing these tests, but so far, none tested by an Oxford University team have passed stringent protocol.",15,Low,Right

The Government's test and trace plan was embroiled in fresh chaos today as a Cabinet minister admitted the NHSX app won't be ready for weeks and it was revealed contact tracers have been receiving shambolic and inadequate training.

Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said during a round of interviews today that the contact tracing app - which was promised to be rolled out from mid-May - would not be ready until at least next month.

A number of potential security flaws suggesting the software can be easily hacked have been flagged to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which are thought to be partly to blame for the hold-up.

It comes after contact tracers revealed they have been given virtually no training and have been getting paid to sit around doing nothing for days on end, with one saying they had 'never been so bored in their life'.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced on Monday that 21,000 tracers would be receiving 'rigorous' and 'detailed' training needed for the important role, seen as crucial for getting the country back up and running.

But the programme has been slammed as shambolic by recruits who say they have been told to watch videos online on how to handle conversations with suspected COVID-19 cases.

Meanwhile, outsourcing firm Serco, one of the companies training Britain's contact tracers, was forced to apologise today after accidentally sharing the email address of 300 of its recruits.

The blunder does not inspire confidence for Britons who will be expected to hand over their private details to companies like Serco in the coming weeks as the country exits lockdown.

Contact tracers are already working in countries like Belgium, above, in the UK, 21,000 people have signed up to help track Covid-19

FROM RIPPING OFF THE TAXPAYER FOR MILLIONS TO USING IMMIGRANTS FOR CHEAP LABOUR: SERCO'S CONTROVERSIES The firm's chief executive is Sir Winston Churchill's grandson Rupert Soames Private contractor Serco has been hit by a sting of controversies in the past few years. The firm - whose chief executive is Sir Winston Churchill's grandson Rupert Soames - runs several services for the government, including immigration removal centres, maintaining RAF bases and recycling services for many councils and turned over £50million profit last year. Serco began life as the UK branch of the Radio Corporation of America, a tech firm, before it was sold off in the 1980s. Its majority shareholder is London-based BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Ltd. As well as accusations of over-billing the taxpayer for tagging phantom criminals, the firm - based in the Hampshire town of Hook - has also been hit by claims of sexual abuse in its detention centres. THE TIMELINE OF SERCO'S BLUNDERS JULY 2013 Taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies - Serco and G4S - for their work tagging criminals, it emerged. Reports revealed that up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the government was billed for every day were not real. The tags had been placed on criminals who were either dead, in jail or had left the country, it was claimed. The accusations prompted Whitehall to scrutinise every government contract given to the two private firms. SEPTEMBER 2013 A Serco-run immigration centre was stung by sexual abuse allegations after a 23-year-old Roma woman claimed she was assaulted. The woman - who wasn't identified - was awaiting deportation at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire after committing an unspecified crime. Two male members of staff were sacked a month later due to 'inappropriate behaviour' with a detainee. Despite the troubles, the Home Office awarded Serco £70million in 2014 to keep operating Yarl's Wood for another eight years. DECEMBER 2013 Serco and fellow private contractor G4S were dumped from tagging criminals as punishment for overcharging the taxpayer. In a dramatic move by ministers, the companies were stripped of the multi-million contracts. Then-Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said rival firm Capita would take on the work. As well as accusations of over-billing the taxpayer for tagging phantom criminals, the firm - based in the Hampshire town of Hook - has also been hit by claims of sexual abuse in its detention centres AUGUST 2014 Campaigners claimed Serco was among a list of private contractors who used immigrant detainees for cheap labour. Corporate Watch, the organisation behind the report, alleged Serco, G4S and others were 'exploiting their captive migrant workforce'. The Guardian reported some detainees held at detention centres were paid as little as £1 an hour. Serco claimed at the time that the paid work was voluntary and in accordance with strict government rules. JANUARY 2015 Female immigrants being held at the Serco-ran Yarl's Wood were treated like animals and sexually abused by staff, a refugee charity claimed. Women for Refugee Women said females held at the centre were watched by male staff in intimate situations including when using the toilet. The charity interviewed 38 women who were recently or currently detained in Yarl's Wood. Six women claimed staff had made sexual suggestions and three alleged they were touched sexually. Seven reported being physically assaulted. Female immigrants being held at the Serco-ran Yarl's Wood were treated like animals and sexually abused by staff, a refugee charity claimed in January 2015 NOVEMBER 2017 Leaked Paradise Papers revealed a law firm branded Serco a 'high risk' client for its troubled past. The Guardian reported that concerns had been raised about Serco's 'history of problems, failures, fatal errors and overcharging'. AUGUST 2018 Serco sparked fury after it emerged it planned to evict hundreds of asylum seekers living in private accommodation in Glasgow without court orders. Officials provide free housing for asylum seekers until their applications are accepted. Serco paused the move to evict tenants whose application was denied after the criticism over the planned action, the BBC reported. The firm was taken to court over the move, which furious activists described as a form of 'housing apartheid'. But Scotland's highest court ruled in November 2019 the eviction of asylum seekers without court orders was lawful. JULY 2019 Serco was fined nearly £23million over fraud and false accounting charges over its electronic tagging scandal. The company faced allegations of billing the taxpayer for electronically monitoring people who were either dead or in jail, or had left the country. It was been fined £19.2million and £3.7million in costs as part of a settlement with the Serious Fraud Office over the scandal. Advertisement

Contact tracers are being employed to track down people by phone or email who have been exposed to an infected coronavirus patient to advise them to self-isolate.

They are set to be deployed along with the NHSX coronavirus app, which alerts users when they have been close to someone with the illness.

But ministers were warned today the app will fail because it is too complex, older people do not own smartphones and not enough people will download it.

Getting the 'track and trace' regime in place is crucial to reviving the economy from lockdown, with unions warning workplaces and schools cannot be safe before then.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this month that the goal was to roll out the regime in 'mid-May', but following a series of blunders has since refused to set a date. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland conceded this morning that the scheme may not be ready for another month.

The Government has been desperately trying to ramp up testing capacity, with MPs condemning the failure to get going on the issue early enough and control freakery from Public Health England (PHE).

One contact tracer, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian he was paid for three days, despite doing virtually no work and receiving little training.

He revealed he was employed as a 'Work at Home Customer Service Adviser' after applying through the job website Indeed.

The man was invited for a day of online training run by outsourcing firm Sitel on Sunday, where there was just one trainer for around 100 tracers.

'We had a chat [box] where we could ask him questions, but the first hour and a half of the training was just people writing, 'I can't hear anything',' he said.

The trainees were told they were being hired as agents in the contact-tracing team acting as the first point of contact for suspected COVID-19 cases.

The man added: 'After the full day of training, people were still asking the most basic things. Someone also asked what they should do if they spoke to someone whose relative had died of the virus and he said we should look on YouTube where there are lots of videos about empathy and sympathy when talking to someone.'

'Then I looked at the rota and it said I was starting the next morning at 9am.'

The man logged in first thing on Monday to an email telling him to standby for instruction. He did nothing all day, but was assured he would still be paid.

One female recruit told the Guardian she had spent three days trying and failing to log into the Sitel system, despite Matt Hancock's assurances it was already up and running smoothly.

Another told the BBC: 'I've never been so bored in my life, it is an extremely expensive way to sit around doing nothing for the state.'

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care insisted recruits were being thoroughly trained before being asked to make calls.

They said claims staff were being asked to use YouTube for advice on how to deal with bereaved relatives was not in line with their training and would be investigated.

'Staff are trained on data security, customer service, safeguarding vulnerable children and adults, operating procedures, and when to escalate issues among other matters,' they said.

'Only applicants that have passed the training modules and technical tests are allowed to move onto the next stage and start work.'

The majority of contact tracing work will be contracted out to at least two companies, including Serco, who are being asked to provide 15,000 call centre staff. Other companies on the Government's shortlist for call centre staff include security firm G4S.

Staff may also be drafted in from NHS 111 and other helplines ran by the Government or private companies.

Ministers have also promised 3,000 former doctors and nurses who have been recruited from the pool of retired NHS staff who volunteered to return to help during the pandemic.

They will be able to provide medical advice to confirmed and suspected patients.

But Serco may have scuppered its chances of securing that contract after accidentally sharing the email address of 300 of trainee contact tracers today.

The Hampshire-based company wrote an email to tell new trainees not to contact its help desk looking for training details.

But the staff member who sent it forgot to mask their email addresses in the CC section of the email - revealing them to every recipient.

A Serco spokesman said: 'An email was sent to new recruits who had given us their permission to use their personal email addresses.

'In error, email addresses were visible to other recipients. We have apologised and reviewed our processes to make sure that this does not happen again.'

It's understood the email addresses where placed in the CC section by a member of staff while writing the message, rather than the BCC, which hides email addresses from other recipients.

Serco has been hit by a sting of controversies in the past few years.

The firm - whose chief executive is Sir Winston Churchill's grandson Rupert Soames - runs several services for the government, including immigration removal centres, maintaining RAF bases and recycling services for many councils.

As well as accusations of over-billing the taxpayer for tagging phantom criminals, the firm - based in the Hampshire town of Hook - has also been hit by claims of sexual abuse in its detention centres.

David Emm, from the cybersecurity firm Kapersky, said the email blunder will raise fears among Britons who will be asked to input their private information into the NHSX contact tracing app when it is rolled out in the coming weeks.

He saidL: 'COVID-19 is uppermost in everyone's minds at the moment; many people will be anxious to do everything they can to limit the spread of the virus, including using of the forthcoming NHS contact tracing app once it's available.

'So it's alarming to learn that a number of security flaws have been found in the app – especially when considering how vital this may be in protecting the country from a second wave of the virus.

RESEARCHERS IDENTIFY 'SECURITY FLAWS' IN NHSX APP Security researchers have highlighted a number of potential flaws in the coronavirus contact tracing app. The issues have been flagged to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is involved in the app's development, and it said it is in the process of fixing them. The researchers also warned legal protections around data use are needed in order to better protect personal privacy on the app, which is currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight. They say data associated with the app should be protected by legislation 'from use by law enforcement, or any usage not directly related to Covid-19 prevention'. Harriet Harman, chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, said on Tuesday that new laws to protect the privacy of personal information gathered by the app are a 'no brainer'. Ms Harman, who has prepared a Bill on the issue which is ready for introduction, said assurances by Health Secretary Matt Hancock do not provide any protection after he wrote to her saying the Government believes legislation is unnecessary because there is already the Data Protection Act. In their study of the contact tracing app, which was shared with the NCSC last week, security researchers Professor Vanessa Teague and Dr Chris Culnane identified a number of issues, including a weakness in the app's registration process which could be exploited by hackers and used to manipulate data or create logs of fake contact events. It also highlighted a flaw which means storing unencrypted data on a user's phone could potentially be used by law enforcement agencies to determine when two or more people met. The research added that generating new random ID codes for users once a day, rather than every 15 minutes like in other systems, makes it theoretically possible to determine intimate details about an app user's lifestyle, such as whether they 'woke up and went to bed with the same person, or more revealingly, if they did not'. Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the NCSC, thanked the researchers and confirmed the app development team is addressing all the issues raised. 'The intent of being open before national launch was to show what the app will do, how it will do it, and to get some peer review from security and privacy researchers,' he wrote in a blog post. 'Thank-you to everyone who's taken the time to look at the design and the beta code and provide us with useful feedback, whether that's directly, on GitHub or through the NCSC's vulnerability disclosure programme. 'Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal).' Dr Levy added the NCSC would not comment on specific legal issues raised by the researchers. In a further statement, a spokesman for the NCSC said: 'Responsible security researchers are an overwhelming force for good and their feedback was openly requested for the quickly developed beta app. 'It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community. 'We look forward to continuing to work with security and cryptography researchers to make the app the best it can be for the public.'

'There have also been concerns raised about data being held centrally, in contrast to the decentralised model being adopted by many other countries.

'Worries about privacy have also prompted the UK Joint Committee on Human Rights to draft a bill that spells out a framework for how data gathered using the app will be stored and used.

'It's important that government ensures the privacy and security of those using the NHS contact tracing app, since its widespread use will require public confidence.'

The Government's test and trace plan was embroiled in more chaos yesterday as it emerged tech experts do not believe the NHSX app will be effective - and health officials warned the outbreak cannot be stamped out by call centre staff with just a few hours' training.

The issues were highlighted after ministers signalled that the deadline for launching the contact tracing software nationwide is being pushed back - with no clear timescale.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this month that the goal was 'mid-May' but has since refused to set a date.

Number 10 would only go so far as saying it will be made available in the 'coming weeks' after experts have 'carefully studied' the findings of a pilot programme on the Isle of Wight. A survey has found just a quarter of IT experts are confident the app will be 'effective'.

Local health officials have warned that it will not be possible to keep infection under control with an army of people in call centres, rather than working in communities.

Getting the 'track and trace' regime in place is crucial to reviving the economy from lockdown, with unions warning workplaces and schools cannot be safe before then.

The government has been desperately trying to ramp up testing capacity, with MPs condemning the failure to get going on the issue early enough and control freakery from Public Health England (PHE).

But the NHSX app is another critical piece of the puzzle. People will be asked to download the software, and it will use bluetooth to detect whether they have been near anyone who has been diagnosed. They can then be told to isolate to stamp out flare-ups of the disease.

The director for Public Health Sheffield Greg Fell warned that test and trace is 'fundamental to breaking chains of transmission and reopening society'.

He admitted he did not 'know the final details of how it will work', and insisted properly trained staff would have to do the 'heavy lifting work'.

Mr Fell highlighted the dangers of relying on the app and call centres alone, saying detailed engagement with communities was key.

'That can't be managed only by people working in a call centre 250 miles away,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Downing Street again refused to give a date for when the new contact tracing programme will begin.

The blame game was also in full swing this week as a Cabinet minister claimed blunders in the coronavirus response were down to 'wrong' science advice.

Therese Coffey insisted the government had just been following the guidance from experts as she fended off damning criticism from MPs over 'inadequate' testing.

The Science and Technology Committee found hospital staff, care home workers and residents were put at risk because of a lack of capacity for screening 'when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant'.

Routine testing for those with symptoms was abandoned on March 12, when the government shifted to its 'delay' phase, with checks reserved for hospital patients and health staff.

HOW WILL CONTACT TRACERS WORK ALONGSIDE THE APP? The bulk of contact tracing work will be contracted out to at least two companies, including Serco, who are being asked to provide 15,000 call centre staff. They will designated specific areas of the country and will receive alerts when NHSX app users come into contact with suspected patients. It is their job to phone these people and advise they self isolate and be vigilant about changes in their health and about social distancing. If they become ill, they will be tested. If a contact becomes infected, the same process begins for them and their social network. The idea is to keep track of how the virus moves through social circles and to try to stay a step ahead of it and prevent wider spread. Ministers have also promised an additional 3,000 former doctors and nurses who have been recruited from the pool of retired NHS staff who volunteered to return to help during the pandemic. They will be able to provide medical advice to confirmed and suspected patients. The tracers will make a list of people considered to have been put at risk by the patient, and those people will be notified that they might have the coronavirus. The NHSX app would need more than 70 per cent of the UK population to download and use it for it to be effective. But ministers say physical contact tracing will make up for the shortcomings of the app if update is below 70 per cent.

But the cross-party MPs said the failure to ramp up testing for the disease was the 'most consequential' error in the crisis, and crippled efforts to trace, track and isolate Britons with the disease.

Justice Secretary Robert Buckland sparked fury today by admitting that ministers 'chose' to protect the NHS over care homes because there was not enough coronavirus testing capacity.

Mr Buckland gave the clearest statement yet that a decision was made to prioritise the health service when the outbreak was at its most ferocious.

More than 11,000 people are now believed to have died in care homes since the disease started running rampant, around a quarter of the UK's total toll. The government has been heavily criticised for sending patients back to homes from hospitals without tests, and not putting routine screening in place for staff and residents.

Mr Buckland fuelled the row this morning by conceding the government had to make a 'choice' about where to deploy testing capacity - which was languishing at a few thousand a day in early March, although it has now been ramped up to over 100,000.

'I think we needed to make a choice about testing and we did decide to focus upon the NHS,' he told Sky News. 'The issue with care homes is that we've got many thousands of different providers, different settings, there have been lots of examples of care homes that have mercifully stayed infection free, but sadly far too many cases of infection and then death.'

Shadow care minister Liz Kendall said the remarks amounted to a concession that 'ministers did not give care homes the protection they needed at the start of this pandemic'.

'Social care and the NHS are both equally important in the fight against this virus and are inextricably linked. One cannot be prioritised above the other,' she said.

Care England chief Martin Green said it was a 'significant' statement from Mr Buckland and he hoped the government will 'learn lessons'.

The spat came after Dame Angela McLean, chief science adviser at the Ministry of Defence, highlighted the role capacity had played in key decisions at the daily media briefing last night.

Dame Angela said the advice given to ministers to abandon efforts to contact trade individual cases, which happened on March 12, 'took account of the testing that was available'.

'With the testing we had the right thing to do was to focus it on people who were really sick in hospital... it was the right thing to do at the time,' she said.

She said the 'scientific advice would be that you need to have a rapid and reliable testing system'. Asked if that was now true, Dame Angela replied: 'I think it is getting better.'

Ministers are warned NHSX coronavirus app will FAIL because it is too complex, older people do not own smartphones and not enough people will download it Ministers were today told the NHSX coronavirus app is 'not a silver bullet to tackle Covid-19' and could fail if not enough people sign up to use it. Everbridge Technologies, a provider of emergency communications systems founded after the 9/11 attacks, said the app needs 60 to 70 per cent uptake in order to slow the spread of the virus. But it highlights that even ubiquitous appls like WhatsApp struggle to attract 70 per cent of mobile phone users. Everbridge t also raised concerns about the Government's decision to use a centralised data system rather than the Apple-Android model which stores users' information on their device. Evidence submitted to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee and Science and Technology Committee pointed out a range of problems that could prevent the app from working effectively. They include: User uptake: To be effective at least 60-80 per cent of people need to install the app. Vulnerable and elderly people are left out: According to Ofcom only 40 per cent of over 65s own a smartphone. Data reliability: The app relies on citizens inputting the correct information and filling out forms with many data points. There is risk of error which could lead to wrong decisions and wrong advice being given. Human impact: The app provides you with a push notification once it has the right information. What is the next step and how will the app ensure users follow through with a test? How can someone communicate with authorities if they need help or advice? Privacy: The app relies on the centralised collection of personal and sensitive health information, which brings with it risks. Technology: New apps need frequent updates; each change is a challenge to uptake and relies on the individual to update their phone.",15,Low,Right
55,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8341219/SAGE-file-claims-BAME-Britons-risk-coronavirus-higher-diabetes-rates.html,Daily Mail,2020-05-20,['Sam Blanchard'],Coronavirus UK: SAGE file says diabetes influences BAME risk,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/20/20/28633064-0-image-a-47_1590001484642.jpg,"Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are no more likely to die from coronavirus than white people, a study given to government scientists has found.

Research presented to Number 10's SAGE panel found there was no greater risk of death for Brits of BAME backgrounds when all factors were taken into account.

It showed that 'comorbidities' - long-term health problems - appeared to account for higher rates of hospitalisation and intensive care among ethnic minority people.

Risk among BAME communities has been a sensitive topic during Britain's outbreak and even given rise to calls for extra protection for non-white NHS staff.

Statistics show BAME people in Britain are dying of COVID-19 at disproportionate rates, but scientists have struggled to explain why.

The research - done by scientists from the universities of Edinburgh and Liverpool - was one of around a dozen secret papers published last night by the government.

It did, however, claim BAME people did seem to be more likely to end up in intensive care in the first place.

The SAGE paper was met with scepticism, however, with one intensive care doctor saying the data it contained did not line up with what the scientists claimed.

Oxford University's Professor Duncan Young said: 'I’m not sure why they thought black patients were more at risk of ICU care.

'The take-home message is that BAME patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are no more likely to end up in ICU nor are they more likely to die.'

Researchers said in a government paper that 'BAME groups are more likely to be admitted to intensive care units' (Pictured: A member of staff in ICU at the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge)

The research was done by Professor Ewen Harrison and Dr Annemarie Docherty, from the University of Edinburgh, and Professor Calum Semple from the University of Liverpool.

They studied 23,577 hospital patients with COVID-19 in the UK before April 11. 11,690 of them were white, 1,135 were 'minority ethnic', 835 were Asian and 568 were black.

Minority ethnic people were most likely to be admitted to intensive care, with a rate of 22.6 per cent, followed by black people, of whom 22.5 per cent were admitted.

The proportion for those of Asian ethnicity was 22 per cent, while it was significantly lower at 15.4 per cent.

The researchers said: 'BAME groups are more likely to be admitted to HDU/ICU.'

They explained that although intensive care admission appeared higher for non-white people, the BAME patients were not more likely to die once on the units.

'When patient characteristics are taken into account,' the paper said, 'no excess HDU/ICU [high dependency/intensive care unit] deaths are seen in the BAME group.'

ETHNIC MINORITY PATIENTS MAKE UP DISPROPORTIONATE COVID-19 DEATHS In NHS hospitals in England, non-white people have so far made up a disproportionate of COVID-19 victims. Scientists do not understand why, whether there are biological reasons such as higher rates of diabetes, or whether more BAME people have caught the virus because they are more likely to live and work in densely populated cities. White people account for 83% of all coronavirus deaths in NHS England hospitals, while they make up 86% of the population. People of Asian ethnicity - which includes south Asian countries such as India, Bangladesh and Pakistan - make up 8% of the COVID-19 deaths but 7.5% of the population. B lack people have accounted for 6% of all coronavirus deaths but just 3.3% of the general population. Mixed race people, meanwhile, account for 1% of deaths and 2.2% of the population.

However, a higher number of admissions in the group would inevitably lead to a higher number of deaths, even if the survival rate is the same across each ethnic group.

Professor Duncan Young, an intensive care lecturer at the University of Oxford, said the link between ethnicity alone and ICU admission was not significant in the study.

He told MailOnline: 'The [data] suggests all ethnic groups were (statistically) equally likely to be admitted to HDU/ICU after all the different co-morbidities and age had been corrected for.

'Similarly, hospital survival was not different across ethnic groups. I’m not sure why they thought black patients were more at risk of ICU care.'

Professor Young added: 'To check the result... they took BAME patients and found matching white patients with similar co-morbidities, age, sex and other relevant features, and then compared the hospital survival.

'There was no difference in hospital mortality between the BAME patients and the matched white patients.

'The take-home message is that BAME patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are no more likely to end up in ICU nor are they more likely to die.'

By way of explaining its claim of higher intensive care admissions among non-white patients, the paper said that long-term health conditions - namely diabetes - were to blame.

'More admissions to HDU/ITU are seen in the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) group, compared to the White ethnic group,' it said.

'These are explained by differences in patient characteristics such as comorbidity. No difference in HDU/ICU admission is seen after adjusting for patient characteristics.'

After highlighting the importance of the 'patient characteristics' in the chance of someone needing intensive care, the report outlined them in two brief sentences.

It said: 'BAME groups are younger and more likely to have diabetes.

'BAME groups were less likely to have other comorbidities such as cardiorespiratory disease and chronic neurological disease/dementia.'

The study found obesity appeared to be the biggest predictor of whether someone would be admitted to intensive care, raising the risk by 84 per cent.

But obesity rates were not seen to be significantly different across ethnic groups - 11.5 per cent black, 9.9 per cent Asian, 9 per cent minority ethnic, 10.3 per cent white.

Type 2 diabetes, however - which is closely linked to obesity - was significantly more common in non-white people.

Rates were 40.5 per cent in black patients, 39.3 per cent among Asian patients, 32 per cent in minority ethnic, and 25.4 per cent among whites.

Professor Paul Hunter, a former NHS doctor and medicine lecturer at the University of East Anglia, said: 'The study shows that BAME are more likely to be admitted to intensive care, once they've been hospitalised, and they are more likely to die.

'But that increased risk is almost certainly because of other health issues that they have, rather than actually the fact that they are black.'

A study published by researchers at University College London in December last year found that ethnic minority people in the UK have higher rates of type 2 diabetes.

Dr Tra My Pham and colleagues found that, using data from more than 400,000 patients in Britain, type 2 diabetes was 2.3 times more common in people of Asian ethnicity than in white people, 65 per cent higher among black people, and 17 per cent higher in those of mixed race.

Paisley Court Care Home, in Dovecot, which can care for up to 60 elderly residents, has recorded at least suspected 20 deaths.

Parent company Care UK said the deaths included those who had shown symptoms but never confirmed to have the virus.

It blamed a lack of 'meaningful levels of testing' in the sector for uncertainty - routine testing was not available until April 15, by which time it was too late for thousands.

More than 12,000 deaths - around a quarter of the total number of coronavirus victims in the UK - have been in care homes, official figures show.

Four out of every 10 care homes in the country say they have had cases at some point.

Officials have come under fire for not offering enough support to care home staff and residents at the beginning of the outbreak, which they deny.

Justice Secretary Robert Buckland sparked fury today by admitting that ministers 'chose' to protect the NHS over care homes because there was not enough coronavirus testing capacity.

Paisley Court Care Home, in Dovecot, today confirmed 20 residents had died after showing coronavirus symptoms, making it one of the worst hit care homes of the pandemic

ONS data yesterday showed that 9,980 people had died in care homes in England and Wales by May 8, and a further 1,411 happened between then and May 15, according to the Care Quality Commission and Care Inspectorate Wales

Paisley Court offers nursing care to older people living with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, and those with complex care needs.

The home confirmed 16 of the 20 residents who passed away died at the care home, while the remaining four died in hospital.

A statement from parent company Care UK said the 20 includes residents who were not tested but were displaying coronavirus symptoms before they died.

They did not say how many had definitely been confirmed positive.

A Care UK spokesperson said: 'Sadly, 20 residents from Paisley Court care home have passed away having shown symptoms which suggested coronavirus.

'Without meaningful levels of testing, we are unable to confirm an exact number, so we have included those who showed even the slightest symptoms in the full total.

'No residents in the home are currently showing any symptoms of coronavirus.'

Care UK's Regional Director Maggie Bustard said: 'This is devastating news for the family and friends of these residents as well as our team. Our thoughts are with those who have lost someone and we send our condolences and best wishes.

'I would like to acknowledge the fantastic team at Paisley Court who have worked so hard to care for these other residents.

'We have a number of measures in place to minimise the risk of infection for both residents and colleagues. We have access to a full supply of personal protective equipment which the team is using in line with Public Health England and NHS guidance.

'Residents are being cared for in their rooms as much as possible and we follow strict isolation processes should anyone show even the slightest symptoms.

'We also have control processes in place to ensure anyone who comes into the home, including our own team, is screened via a health and temperature check.'

Latest figures show at least 12,800 COVID-19 deaths have occurred in UK care homes, out of a total of 44,000 total covid deaths to date.

That includes more than 11,000 in England and Wales up until May 8, more than 1,630 in Scotland up until May 16, and 269 in Northern Ireland until May 8.

Last week, the ONS said more than 12,500 people living in care homes have died with COVID-19 which included all care home residents who died with coronavirus either at their care home or in hospital.

It suggests the overall care home resident death figure is 25 per cent higher than the total reported by the ONS.

The Prime Minister Boris Johnson today confirmed 131 social care workers had died from COVID-19 and at least 181 NHS staff.

Another measurement of the scale of the problem in care homes is 'excess of mortality'.

The term is used to describe when more people die than would be expected under normal conditions, either from COVID-19 or something else.

AGENCY WORKERS CONTRIBUTED TO VIRUS SPREAD IN CARE HOMES Temporary care workers helped to fuel Britain's coronavirus crisis in care homes, a damning Government study has found. Agency staff working in multiple homes may have unwittingly infected thousands of elderly and vulnerable residents without being tested for the virus. In some cases 'bank workers' – used to fill temporary vacancies – were standing in for full-time carers who were self-isolating to protect the residents. Public Health England researchers analysing the virus' genome traced outbreaks in London care homes back to the temporary workers. The unpublished PHE study, seen by the Guardian, analysed the behaviour of the virus in six care homes in London from April 11 to April 13, over Easter weekend. The study warned: 'Infection is spreading from care home to care home, linked to changed patterns of staffing, working across and moving between homes.' It said the agency staff were often asymptomatic, which meant 'by the time local health protection teams are informed of an outbreak substantial transmission may already have occurred.' Care homes were hugely reliant on bank staff at the peak of the crisis in April, when a quarter of the workforce were self-isolating. Results of the research were handed to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at the end of last month. But the findings were only circulated last week to care home providers, councils and local public health directors - fuelling allegations care homes were left in the lurch. The government is facing scathing criticism over claims it abandoned care homes in its scramble to protect the NHS from the infection. Advertisement

That shows twice as many people have died in care homes in England, Wales and Scotland during the coronavirus pandemic than would be expected in normal times.

An extra 21,813 deaths have occurred in care homes in England Wales and 2,054 additional deaths in care homes in Scotland compared to the five year average.

It means an additional 10,000 or so deaths have not been caused directly by COVID-19, but they would not have been expected to happen if the pandemic didn't hit Britain.

Paisley Court reported a further four residents had passed away due to causes not related to COVID-19.

'No residents in the home are currently showing any symptoms of coronavirus.'

Four out of every 10 care home in the UK has now had a coronavirus case at some point, the Prime Minister's spokesman confirmed.

Data from Public Health England found that 5,889 care settings - 38 per cent - had reported a suspected outbreak, a rise of 300 outbreaks in just one week.

In Scotland, there are currently 484 (45 per cent) adult care homes with a current case of suspected COVID-19.

Last week, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that all residents and members of staff in care homes in England would be able to receive a test for coronavirus even if they were not showing symptoms of the disease.

But the move came after the coronavirus had already rippled through the sector, taking the lives of thousands.

The true scale of the crisis is unknown because of a lack of routine testing.

The Government's response in protecting care homes has been a contentious issue, as ministers have faced increasing criticism for their slow response.

Today was the first time a minister - Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - admitted ministers 'chose' to protect the NHS over care homes. It was the clearest statement yet that a decision was made to prioritise the health service when the outbreak was at its most ferocious.

'I think we needed to make a choice about testing and we did decide to focus upon the NHS,' he told Sky News.

Care England chief Martin Green said it was a 'significant' statement from Mr Buckland and he hoped the government will 'learn lessons'.

But just hours later, Mr Buckland tried to retract his statement, telling ITV News it was a 'false dichotomy' to suggest a choice was made between the two.

It comes as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned a claim made by the Health Secretary that a 'protective ring was thrown around care homes from start'.

He said today that claim was 'flatly contradicted' by the chief executive of Care England, Professor Martin Green, who said on Tuesday 'we should have been focusing on care homes from the start'.

The advice to hospitals from the April 2 to April 15 was that 'negative tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home'.

'What’s protective about that?' Sir Keir asked the PM - who said 'no one was discharged into a care home this year without the express authorisation of a clinician'.

It follows Liz Kendall, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Social Care, slamming the Government for its delayed approach yesterday after the latest ONS figures.

Addressing Matt Hancock at the House of Commons, she said: 'Can the Health Secretary explain why guidance saying care homes were very unlikely to be infected wasn't withdrawn until March 12, when the Chief Medical Officer warned about community transmission and the risk to the elderly on March 4?'

In response, Mr Hancock said the guidance was in place while 'community transmission was low'.

Ms Kendall continued: 'Can he explain why there was no requirement to test those being discharged to care homes, the very group most at risk, until April 15?

'It took until mid-April for the Government to produce a health and social care plan, until the end of April to say all residents and staff should be tested, and until May 11 to set a deadline for achieving this, and that deadline still isn't until June 6.'

Mr Hancock said it was 'important to remember' hospital was also a dangerous place to pick up the virus. Therefore it is appropriate in many cases for patients to go to a care home.

He appeared to pass the buck to care homes, which had been instructed to put infection control procedures in from the beginning of the pandemic.",15,Low,Right

Researchers in Hong Kong studied transmission of the virus between hamsters, with half infected with COVID-19 and the other being healthy.

They analysed various scenarios in which the hamsters cages were either cloaked with face mask material or not.

Although it's completely different to how humans interact, the researchers said it showed 'very clearly' that covering the nose and mouth is hugely effective to mitigate spread.

The study comes after months of conflicting information from world health bodies concerning masks and if the public should wear them.

The British government recently U-turned and encouraged people to wear coverings when social distancing isn't possible.

It had previously feared that the advice would leave a shortage of surgical masks for healthcare workers.

Pictured: Residents wearing a face mask at San Biagio and Santa Maria Immacolata church on May 20, in Codogno, southeast of Milan

The study was released by the department of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong but has not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal yet.

It involved two groups of hamsters - one were infected with COVID-19, some of which were not displaying symptoms, and the other were perfectly healthy.

A fan was placed between the cages to allow for the transmission of respiratory droplets from the infected hamsters' cage to the other.

THE TRUTH ABOUT FACE MASKS: WHAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN Research on how well various types of masks and face coverings varies but, recently, and in light of the pandemic of COVID-19, experts are increasingly leaning toward the notion that something is better than nothing. A University of Oxford study published on March 30 concluded that surgical masks are just as effective at preventing respiratory infections as N95 masks for doctors, nurses and other health care workers. It's too early for their to be reliable data on how well they prevent infection with COVID-19, but the study found the thinner, cheaper masks do work in flu outbreaks. The difference between surgical or face masks and N95 masks lies in the size of particles that can - and more importantly, can't - get though the materials. N95 respirators are made of thick, tightly woven and molded material that fits tightly over the face and can stop 95 percent of all airborne particles, while surgical masks are thinner, fit more loosely, and more porous. This makes surgical masks much more comfortable to breathe and work in, but less effective at stopping small particles from entering your mouth and nose. Droplets of saliva and mucous from coughs and sneezes are very small, and viral particles themselves are particularly tiny - in fact, they're about 20-times smaller than bacteria. For this reason, a JAMA study published this month still contended that people without symptoms should not wear surgical masks, because there is not proof the gear will protect them from infection - although they may keep people who are coughing and sneezing from infecting others. But the Oxford analysis of past studies- which has not yet been peer reviewed - found that surgical masks were worth wearing and didn't provide statistically less protection than N95 for health care workers around flu patients. However, any face mask is only as good as other health and hygiene practices. Experts universally agree that there's simply no replacement for thorough, frequent hand-washing for preventing disease transmission. Some think the masks may also help to 'train' people not to touch their faces, while others argue that the unfamiliar garment will just make people do it more, actually raising infection risks. So what about cloth coverings? Although good quality evidence is lacking, some data suggest that cloth masks may be only marginally (15 per cent) less effective than surgical masks in blocking emission of particles, said Babak Javid, principal investigator at Cambridge University Hospitals wrote in the BMJ on April 9. He pointed to a study led by Public Health England in 2013 which found wearing some kind of material over the face was fivefold more effective than not wearing masks for preventing a flu pandemic. The study suggested that a homemade mask 'should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection'.

When there was no face mask coverings on the cages, two-thirds of the healthy hamsters caught the coronavirus within a week.

In the scenario in which mask barriers were placed only on cages with the infected hamsters, the transmission rate dropped by 75 per cent.

Just over 15 per cent of the healthy hamsters got sick compared to 66 per cent before.

In the scenario where healthy hamsters were shielded with a masked barrier, 33 per cent were infected, showing it was only half as effective.

The researchers added that the hamsters who were infected even with the mask barrier had less of the virus in their bodies when compared to those infected without the masks.

'The findings implied to the world and the public is that the effectiveness of mask-wearing against the coronavirus pandemic is huge,' lead author and coronavirus expert Dr Yuen Kwok-yung told a news briefing, according to Sky News.

'In our hamster experiment, it shows very clearly that if infected hamsters or humans -especially asymptomatic or symptomatic ones - put on masks, they actually protect other people.

'That's the strongest result we showed here. Transmission can be reduced by 50 percent when surgical masks are used, especially when masks are worn by infected individuals.'

Dr Kwok-yung said that until a vaccine for he virus is found, social distancing or wearing a mask are the best preventative measure working in tandem.

But it does not stop the spread entirely.

Dr Kwok-yung, who worked on the SARS virus in 2003, said that his team conducted the study world leaders, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), had questioned their effectiveness.

The WHO said there is no evidence masks cut the risk of transmission, while raising concerns there could be a shortage of masks for medical workers if they are bought by the general public.

The leading body acknowledged the virus can be transmitted by people who do not have symptoms.

But still says only two types of people should wear masks: those who are sick and show symptoms, and those who are caring for people who are suspected to have the coronavirus.

Masks are not seen as a reliable protection tool in comparison to hand washing or keeping socially distant from people. They can give a false sense of security that someone is completely protected.

The virus is spread by droplets, which can still enter the mask if it is not fitted well, and contact with contaminated surfaces.

A team from the University of East Anglia (UEA) also concluded there was no strong evidence that face masks can protect healthy people.

Lead author Professor Paul Hunter said: 'It's important to remember that we have not been able to look specifically at COVID-19 because there have been no specific studies to date.'

But other academics argue that despite a lack of evidence to show it reduces spreading, there was nothing to be lost in using face masks just in case.

WEAR A MASK ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT OR IN SHOPS WHERE YOU CAN'T SOCIAL DISTANCE Wear a face mask on public transport or in shops where you can't social distance, new guidance from May 10 said. People should wear a face covering on public transport or in shops where social distancing is not always possible, the Government announced. Official advice released this afternoon said the coverings will help people avoid transmitting the disease to others if they have it without any symptoms. It added that homemade cloth face-coverings can help reduce the risk, but surgical masks or respirators should continue to be reserved for healthcare workers. Ministers added that face coverings should not be used by children aged under two or those with respiratory conditions. People who may find it difficult to manage the masks correctly such as primary age children unassisted are also advised not to wear them. Officials said the new guidance was being issued in response to there being 'more movement outside people's immediate household' as Britons start returning to work. While the Prime Minister has insisted that social distancing 'must be maintained', he did not mention the use of face coverings during his address to the UK last night.

International researchers, led by the University of Oxford, said: 'Even limited protection could prevent some transmission of COVID-19 and save lives. Because COVID-19 is such a serious threat, wearing masks in public should be advised.'

The UK government first took the stance that masks were not necessary for the public, which was not in tune with America, where officials dramatically switched their stance overnight.

Ministers came under mounting pressure to change their advice, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer arguing face masks would be an 'inevitable' part of easing the draconian restrictions.

It finally revised its advice on May 10 to recommend people wear face coverings in confined places where social distancing is difficult. This means it is still voluntary.

Italy had urged citizens to do so more than a month before, and Germans were told to wear coverings in shops and on public transport on April 16.

In France, the government originally said masks were unnecessary, but made it mandatory to wear them on public transport and in secondary schools in the first week of May.

From tomorrow, it is compulsory to wear a face mask in public in Spain.

In Asia, wearing a face mask was pretty standard before the pandemic even existed. It is seen as considerate to keep your nose and mouth covered to protect others from yourself, and irresponsible to not do so.

In some parts of China, you could be arrested or punished for not wearing a mask and people in Singapore can face a fine.

Dr David Nabarro, the UN body's COVID-19 envoy, has warned people will need to get accustomed to a 'new reality' of always wearing a facial covering.

How to make your own coronavirus face mask: Online DIY tutorials detail method for vacuum cleaner bag or T-shirt to create protection that leading scientists say is effective against bug

The worldwide coronavirus pandemic has led to a shortage of protective face masks, leading to a deluge of online tutorials ion how to make your own using a t-shirt or pillowcase.

Homemade masks offer significantly less protection than the N95 medical masks, which are made of a thick, tightly woven material that fits over the face and can stop 95 per cent of all airborne particles.

Public Health England still does not recommend Britons wear face masks, unless in a medical setting.

But there are good reasons to think DIY masks could be effective in tackling the pandemic, as they have been widely used in Hong Kong,Mongolia and South Korea -countries that largely have the disease under control.

MailOnline has investigated how you can make your own face mask using everyday household items such as a t-shirt, kitchen towel or vacuum bags.

How to make a face mask from a t-shirt

A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray shows how to make a face mask without any need for sewing, using just a plain t-shirt.

First of all you need scissors, pencil and a ruler, and a t-shirt you don't mind being used to make a face mask.

Cut out a 16' by 4' rectangle from the middle of the t-shirt, then fold it in half, and measure four inches on either side.

Then mark the t-shirt with an even number of tassels on each side and use scissors to cut them.

Turn the t-shirt inside out and separate the corner tassels, but tie the remaining ones in-between.

Then with the remaining t-shirt material cut some ear straps using the hem of the shirt.

Attach the straps to the remaining outer tassels and you have yourself a face mask, with no sewing involved, and using an old t-shirt.

A slightly more complicated method has been perfected by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh also managed to design a face mask that could be used if 'commercial masks' are not available during a virus outbreak.

They used a regular cotton t-shirt, which was boiled for 10 minutes and then air-dried to sterilise the material, but also to shrink it.

The researchers used a marker and ruler to measure out what they wanted to cut and then formed the mask using an outer layer and then eight inner layers covering the nose and mouth.

The mask does not require any sewing, and instead involves it being tied multiple time around the face.

How to make a face mask from vacuum cleaner bags

By following the simple steps in the graphic, you can create your own face mask from a T-Shirt or vacuum cleaner bag,

Even UK politicians have got in on the act, with Gillian Martin, who is MSP for Aberdeenshire East, describing how she made a face mask from vacuum cleaner bags and elastic.

She told the Daily Record: 'I live in a small village and have been here for over 20 years. I don't want to worry or offend people when I go out.

'I started researching what other countries have been doing and came across a chart with the best materials to use to make a mask out of just about anything.'

'Just below medical material was a hoover bag. I have loads of them lying around and found Hepa-Flow bag that just goes on your Henry hoover'.

The chart the MSP is referring to from a University of Cambridge study which shows the materials that work the best against virus sized particles.

The top three are a surgical mask, vacuum cleaner bag and tea towel.

She added: 'I cut it up the bag and secured it with elastic. I live with my family of three who have all been self-isolating so I made one for each of us'.

Gillian Martin posted about her mask that she made from a vacuum cleaning bag

'I made it because I'm nervous of people coming up to me when I'm out walking the dog. I don't want to have to run away from them.'

Another popular YouTube method shows how to fold up a scarf, using hair ties at either end, to make a simple and easy no-sew mask. The same method can be used with a handkerchief and doesn't involve any sewing.

How to make a face mask from kitchen towel

For this you need two layers of kitchen towel and one of tissue.

You cut it in half, and then use masking tape on each end to ensure the mask is stiff.

Then you punch holes through either end of the mask and thread elastic bands through the holes.

Some Japanese women have even been posting instructions about how to make a face mask from a braThe method is simple and involves cutting off one cup with scissors and then sewing the bra straps on, so they can be attached to your face.

What types of masks can you buy online and how much do they cost?

This pack of two FFP3 masks is the best selling product for the type of respirator on Amazon

High-grade dust masks now used on NHS frontline: FFP3 face masks cost £40 for two

FFP3 masks are the gold standard for preventing the spread of airborne illnesses in hospitals.

They must fit tightly to the face and have all air drawn through a filter that is embedded in the fabric and catches almost every kind of particle as the air flows through.

They are primarily used as dust masks in the construction industry.

The masks are not widely available to members of the public online.

The top listing on Amazon - made by Wrexham-based company Toolpak - has sold out both on the marketplace and the firm's own website.

Toolpak's masks appear to be being sold by a third party for £39.99 for a pack of two on Amazon.

The N95 face mask being sold for £6.99 online is the US equivalent of the FFP2 mask in Europe

3M N95 masks are being sold for £25.99 for a six-pack on Amazon

Silver standard masks used by medical workers in US and UK: N95/FFP2 face mask cost £6.99 each

The N95 face mask is the US equivalent of the FFP2 mask in Europe and is backed by the World Health Organisation as suitable for medical use.

Its filter is not as strong as the FFP3 - it weeds out 95 per cent of particles, as the name suggests - but it is still highly rated for NHS staff.

UK health officials say FFP2 masks are second best to FFP3, and should be used if possible because they have a European seal of approval, but N95, which doesn't have CE approval, can be used if no FFP2 masks are available.

Masks of this grade are more readily available online from sellers in China.

The Amazon bestseller is a N95 mask sold by HJHY, a company based in China. They cost £6.99 but may not be delivered for a month or more. 43 per cent of people who bought the mask rated it just one star out of five.

Another product in Amazon's bestseller category is a £25.99 six-pack of N95 masks made by 3M and sold by Hpparty, another company based in China. Delivery dates start in mid-May and there are no customer reviews.

These disposable face mask covers offer some protection to users against respiratory diseases

Disposable surgical masks still used in most NHS hospitals: Ten for £9.39

The best known type of medical face mask, known as a surgical mask, is still being widely used by the NHS.

Doctors, nurses and healthcare workers are now instructed to wear these types of mask as a minimum at all times when working near confirmed or suspected coronavirus patients.

They are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care or who are not inserting or removing breathing equipment.

Although they don't have built-in air filters, the masks can stop droplets of liquid, which are how the majority of the COVID-19 viruses are spread.

The best-selling product of this type under 'masks and respirators' on Amazon today is a ten-piece set of disposable face covers which costs £9.39.

The mask - with an average review rating of 3.5 stars - has an inner layer of cotton fabric, a middle layer of medical filter paper and an outer layer of waterproof fabric. It is sold by a company in London and delivers in early May.

Another top seller is a pack of 20 costing £7.97 and shipping from a company called T-Shell in Guangdong, China.

These types of masks are typically not reusable and should only be used for one day at a time.

Cycling masks can also provide people with a layer of protection from airborne particles

This mask is for sale for £11.99 on Amazon

Cycling masks designed to filter out pollution but with potential to stop viruses: £7.57 for six

While cycling masks remain untested regarding coronavirus, they are intended to provide a layer of protection from airborne particles.

They are designed to stop cyclists breathing in pollution when they ride through areas with heavy traffic.

They contain an air filter for this purpose, but are not regulated to the same standard as medical face masks so provide varying levels of protection.

High quality cycling masks, such as those made by the well-known UK brand Cambridge Mask Co. cost upwards of £20 and are reusable. The company has now sold out of all stock but is taking pre-orders.

Other cycling masks are available on Amazon, with the site's bestseller a £7.57 pack of six from a company called Diyii in China. The firm says the masks are good for those with sensitive skin allergies and can be washed repeatedly, and are also suitable for camping, running, travel and climbing.

Another top seller on the marketplace is a reusable mask sold by the Chinese firm KZKR-EU which costs £11.99 per mask and claims it will deliver within two weeks.

This valved gas mask is claimed to match up to the highest filtration standard

This rubber-sealed, military-looking mask is for sale for £29.87 on Amazon

The dramatic option: Respirator gas mask costing £34.86 for one

Perhaps the most dramatic-looking option of all masks is the gas mask respirator.

These are generally used by people spraying paint or other chemicals which it would be dangerous to inhale, or working in hazardous environments.

The masks have built-in valves fitted with filters which may be able to keep out droplets carrying the coronavirus.

The top listing on Amazon is a mask costing £34.86 and sold by SafeYear, a company based in Shanghai, China. The mask is rated FFP3, meaning it would be suitable for even the riskiest medical procedures.

Another top listed option on the site is a full-face rubber-sealed black mask which costs £29.87.

It is sold by the company Maikoler, based in China, and says it would be delivered by the end of May. The military-looking contraption has no customer ratings.

T-shirts, bandanas and even sanitary towels: Homemade face masks may offer protection, too

Many people are opting to make masks at home using cloth or other materials - some have even been pictured using sanitary towels.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US recommends people use cloth face coverings when they go out in public and even has a how-to guide for people to make their own out of t-shirts or bandanas.

The intention of these is not specifically to protect people from catching the virus but to prevent the spread of it by encouraging such widespread use that people who are infected but don't know about it wear something that blocks the viruses being expelled on their breath.

However, European researchers have suggested these may not be effective and up to 90 per cent of particles can make their way through the fabric.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said rates of illness were much higher among healthcare staff using masks made out of cloth instead of surgical masks.

It said: 'Altogether, common fabric cloth masks are not considered protective against respiratory viruses and their use should not be encouraged.

'In the context of severe personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, and only if surgical masks or respirators are not available, homemade cloth masks (e.g. scarves) are proposed as a last-resort interim solution by the US CDC until availability of standard PPE is restored.'",15,Low,Right

Researchers at University College London said their study proves the simple act can can protect you against the killer infection.

They studied more than 1,600 Britons over three winter seasons in the past to see how often they caught the common cold, which is caused by similar coronaviruses.

Participants had reported their hand hygiene routine, describing it as low, moderate or high.

Those who washed their hands moderately - between six to ten times daily - slashed the risk of falling ill by 36 per cent compared to those who did it zero to five times a day.

Washing your hands up to ten times each day slashes the risk of catching COVID-19 by a third, a study suggests

The World Health Organisation's hand-washing method has six distinct steps (two to seven) which involve washing different parts of the hands to get rid of as much bacteria as possible

First author of the study Sarah Beale, from UCL's Institute of Health Informatics, said: 'Given that Covid-19 appears to demonstrate similar transmission mechanisms to seasonal coronaviruses, these findings support clear public health messaging around the protective effects of handwashing during the pandemic.

'It's important to highlight that frequency of handwashing is only one aspect of hand hygiene.

'We also know that both longer duration of handwashing and the context of handwashing e.g. upon returning home or before eating – have been associated with lower overall risk of influenza or influenza-like-illness.

'Good hand hygiene should be practised at all times regardless of whether you show symptoms or not.

'This will help protect yourself and prevent unwittingly spreading the virus to others around you.'

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO WASH HANDS? The World Health Organisation's advice is for people to wash their hands at least five times a day with soap and water or hand sanitiser. Friction, experts say, is the key to scrubbing off any signs of infection. Proper hand-washing involves rubbing the palms together, rubbing the backs of the hands, interlocking fingers both backwards and forwards, scrubbing the thumbs and washing the fingertips. The main route of transmission for the virus is through virus-laden droplets from coughs and sneezes. These droplets can land directly into another person's nose or mouth if not caught in a tissue, which is avoidable by keeping a safe distance - at least 1.5 metres - away from other people. The droplets can also fall due to gravity and land on surfaces, where it can live for up to three days. If someone else touches that contaminated surface, the virus can transfer onto their hand. It only takes them touching their eyes, mouth, or nose for the virus to enter the body. People touch their faces 23 times on average, according to one study in 2015. So washing hands frequently to expel the virus could mitigate the risk of infection. The soap and water dissolves a fat membrane around the virus particle, which is there to protect the genetic material like glue. Once this is broken down, it is killed. Advertisement

The research, which has been published in Wellcome Open Research but not peer-reviewed, draws on data from three winter cohorts (2006 to 2009) of the England-wide Flu Watch study.

Each of the 1,633 participants provided baseline estimates of hand hygiene behaviour and coronavirus infections were identified from nasal swabs.

Participants, of which 80 per cent were over the age of 156, were asked to estimate how many times they had washed their hands the previous day.

Frequency of daily handwashing was subsequently categorised as low, zero to five times daily, moderate, six to 10 times daily, or high, more than 10 times daily.

Although moderate hand washing was shown to cut the risk of sickness, any more than ten times a day did not make a difference.

Ellen Fragaszy, UCL Institute of Health Informatics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'Something as simple as washing our hands regularly can help us to keep the infection rate low and reduce transmissions.'

The authors write: 'This is the first empirical evidence that regular handwashing can reduce personal risk of acquiring seasonal coronavirus infection.

'These findings support clear public health messaging around the protective effects of hand washing in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic.'

Researchers have suggested that alternating between 50 days of strict lockdown and 30 days of more relaxed social distancing could be the safest way forward.

Under such a scenario an epidemic could last a year and a half, they said, but the number of people dying could be drastically reduced.

On the other hand, if governments did nothing and let the virus run rampant, the crisis could be over in six months but millions of people would die.

Their study comes as scientists and politicians in the UK grapple with the best way to help the nation out of the tight lockdown it has now been in for almost two months.

Regular periods of the the same strictness and the same length, separated by a month of lenience each time, could be the least damaging way to squash the virus out of existence, they said.

The team added that it would 'allow populations and their natural economies to breathe at intervals - a potential that might make this solution more sustainable'.

It could 'buy valuable time to shore up health systems and increase efforts to develop new treatments or vaccines'.

Researchers led by the University of Cambridge said stricter lockdown rules would make an outbreak carry on for longer but would keep the numbers of deaths lower. If governments in 16 countries around the world did nothing they could expect 7.8million people to die within six months, the scientists said, whereas if they used a system of regular six-week strict lockdowns they could keep deaths to around 130,000

Dr Rajiv Chowdhury, an epidemiologist at Cambridge, led the research which was modelled on 16 varied countries around the world.

Daily death toll from Covid-19 could fall to almost zero by the end of next month, expert claims The daily number of deaths from coronavirus could be approaching zero by the end of next month, an expert suggested yesterday. Professor Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, said: 'I think by the end of June we'll be looking at the data and finding it difficult to find people with this illness, if current trends continue.' Professor Dame Angela McLean, deputy chief scientific adviser, said yesterday that there was a 'sustained decline across all four of our nations' in the numbers of Covid-19 hospital patients requiring mechanical ventilation – a marker of those who have been worst affected after contracting the virus. She also said there was a continued 'steady decline' in the number of coronavirus-related deaths. Advertisement

Those were Australia, Belgium, Chile, the Netherlands, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Mexico, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Afghanistan and Burkina Faso.

None of the countries are known to be using the 50/30 method, but the epidemiologists modelled its effects on what they would expect in each nation.

'Although we didn't model the situation in the UK, I'd expect it to be very similar to that in other high income countries,' Dr Chowdhury said, referring to Australia, Belgium, Chile and the Netherlands.

The paper drew up three possible scenarios for getting the COVID-19 pandemic under control and looked at how they would affect the length of the outbreak and the number of deaths it would case.

In general, a stricter lockdown system would lengthen the outbreak but reduce deaths, while loose rules get it over with quickly but could kill millions of people.

Professor Oscar Franco, from the University of Bern in Switzerland, said: 'There is no simple answer to the question of which strategy to choose.

'Countries will have to weigh up the dilemma of preventing COVID-19 related deaths and public health system failure with long-term economic collapse and hardship.'

In the 'do nothing' scenario, the pandemic would burn itself out in around 200 days (6.5 months) but kill some 7.8million people across 16 nations.

The death toll would be so huge, the researchers said, because the number of people needing intensive care 'would quickly exceed the available capacity significantly for every country'.

In the second scenario, countries could set up a cycle of 50 days of medium lockdown measures, such as social distancing, school closures, restricting large public events and isolating infected people, following by 30 days of relaxation.

During the relaxation period people would be encouraged to stay apart from one another but schools might be able to reopen and events to go ahead.

HOW DOES THE UK GOVERNMENT PLAN TO END LOCKDOWN? STEP ONE (started May 13) People are allowed to return to work if they cannot do their jobs from home. This does not apply to non-essential retail and hospitality, which must remain closed. Everyone should avoid public transport if they can, and walk, cycle or drive to where they need to go. People can spend as much time as they like outdoors, and may travel by car to spend time outside. They can play sports with people they live with, and meet up with one person from outside of their household at a time. Social distancing (2m) must be maintained always. STEP TWO (June 1 earliest) Schools may partially reopen to children in years 1 and 6 and for a wider range of 'essential' workers' families. People may also be able to join two households into a social 'bubble' in which people from two homes can mix as much as they like. Sporting events and concerts could also restart but without crowds or audiences - for television only. High street shops may be allowed to start reopening, with social distancing in place. Hospitality places, like bars, pubs and restaurants must remain closed. Step three (July 1 earliest) Plans could include the reopening of businesses that were still closed: pubs, restaurants and hotels, hairdressers and beauty salons, churches and lesiure facilities like cinemas,. But there is still a caveat at this stage that some places will not be able to open. 'Some venues which are, by design, crowded and where it may prove difficult to enact distancing may still not be able to re-open safely at this point, or may be able to open safely only in part,' the government warns.

In this second scenario, the reproduction rate of the virus (R) could be held at about 0.8 - meaning every 10 people would infect eight more, so the outbreak would be shrinking - but it would take longer for the case number to get to zero.

An pandemic would last between 12 and 18 months using those rules and kill around 3.5million people in the 16 countries, Dr Chowdhury and his colleagues said.

The third and strictest rule could be a similar 50/30 cycle, but this time with a strict lockdown for 50 days before 30 days of relaxed rules.

During that time of 'suppression', the team said, conditions would be similar to those currently in place in Britain, with strict physical distancing enforced and non-essential businesses closed.

This would push the R rate to 0.5, shrinking the outbreak at pace, but it would take longer for the epidemic to come to an end.

Under this scenario, it would take longer than 18 months for the virus to peter out, the researchers said, but deaths across the 16 countries could be kept to around 130,000.

One of the reasons stricter rules would take longer to dampen the outbreak is that one of the best defences against a virus is herd immunity.

Herd immunity is a situation in which such a large proportion of people are immune to a virus - either because they've had it or they've been vaccinated - that it does not have a large enough pool of potential victims to infect.

By keeping people in lockdown and protecting them from the virus, the process of achieving herd immunity is slowed down because fewer people are exposed.

It has the benefit, however, of enabling hospitals to care for everyone who needs it without getting overloaded, preventing deaths that could be caused by a lack of medical help.

Dr Chowdhury said: 'This intermittent combination of strict social distancing, and a relatively relaxed period, with efficient testing, case isolation, contract tracing and shielding the vulnerable, may allow populations and their natural economies to ""breathe"" at intervals - a potential that might make this solution more sustainable, especially in resource-poor regions.'

The researchers said the rules would not have the same effects in every country and different economies would have to consider what was right for them.

The University of Bern's Dr Franco added: 'Our study provides a strategic option that countries can use to help control COVID-19 and delay the peak rate of infections.

The study showed how in the 'do nothing' scenario (pink) there would be a short, sharp spike in the number of people needing intensive care. The scientists said this would overwhelm hospitals in every country. Meanwhile, in phased lockdown cycles (blue and orange), the surges in intensive care units would happen more often but be smaller and make it easier for hospitals to cope

'This should allow them to buy valuable time to shore up their health systems and increase efforts to develop new treatments or vaccines.

'There’s no simple answer to the question of which strategy to choose. Countries – particularly low-income countries – will have to weigh up the dilemma of preventing COVID-19 related deaths and public health system failure with the long-term economic collapse and hardship.'

This death rate, estimated by researchers at Stanford University in California, would make COVID-19 10 times as deadly as the flu.

It could also mean that around 4.65million people in the UK have had the virus already, based on an estimated 48,417 people having died of the disease so far.

Scientists have been unable to work out how deadly the virus really is because to do so you need to know the true number of people who have had it.

But many COVID-19 patients around the world are not being diagnosed either because their symptoms are so mild that they don't realise they're ill, or they don't fit the criteria for government testing.

The Stanford team's estimate sits at the top of the range of various calculations which have emerged in recent scientific papers, ranging from 0.1 - the same as the flu - to now 1.04 per cent.

If true, the figure would mean the disease kills one in every 100 people who catches it.

A death rate of 1.04 per cent could mean 4.65million people in the UK have had the coronavirus already - significantly fewer than other death rate models from past studies have suggested

The researchers estimated the death rate of the virus using a complex algorithm based on the number of people testing positive in 139 countries around the world.

They combined this with how accurate the tests were thought to be to create what they described as 'a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort'.

It looked at how each country was deciding who to test, how many of their tests were positive, and took into account numbers of false negatives.

Running the numbers through their formula the researchers - Richard Grewelle and Giulio De Leo - put the global estimated infection fatality rate of the virus at 1.04 per cent.

It was somewhere between 0.77 per cent and 1.38 per cent, they said, with 1.04 their accepted mid-point.

The paper was published on the website MedRxiv without being reviewed by other scientists to check for errors.

OFFICIAL FIGURES SUGGEST UP TO 222,000 BRITONS HAVE VIRUS RIGHT NOW Up to 222,000 people in England may be infected with the coronavirus right now, according to a government testing survey which was published for the first time last week. The first round of random public testing identified only 33 positive cases of COVID-19 out of a sample of 10,705 people and estimated a national infection level of 0.27 per cent - one in every 370 people. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said at a Downing Street briefing that the data represented 'really quite a low level of infection' in the community. This suggests that 148,000 people had the virus at any given time between April 27 and May 10, that figure being the middle estimate between a low of 94,000 and high of 222,000. During that time 66,343 people were officially diagnosed. And the rate of infection is six times higher in healthcare workers and carers than it is in the general population, the survey found. While 1.33 per cent of people who worked in patient-facing roles in hospitals or homes tested positive for the virus, only 0.22 per cent of those with other jobs did so. Numbers announced did not include anyone who was tested in a care home or a hospital, where the statisticians said 'rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be higher'. Most official testing, which has picked up around 250,000 positive cases over the entire outbreak, is being done in hospitals and care homes. The Office for National Statistics is soon expected to publish antibody data showing how many people have had the infection already but does not currently have enough data for a reliable estimate. The current survey, of which this is the first set of data, will be ongoing as part of the government's 'test, track and trace' plan for getting out of lockdown and will be expanded to regular testing in more than 10,000 households.

'Our estimated IFR [infection fatality rate] aligns with many previous estimates and is the first attempt at a global estimate of COVID-19 IFR,' the scientists said.

The difficulty of estimating a global fatality rate, they said, is made greater by differences in testing strategies across countries, as well as factors which make some populations more or less at risk of severe disease.

The researchers added: 'The estimate of IFR in one locality will differ from the IFR in another due to differences in underlying health conditions, demography, and medical treatment.

'Rather than understanding the extent of the variability these factors can create in IFR measurements, we derive a new approach to IFR estimation using global data.

'Provided testing has prioritized people at highest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the metric of relative testing capacity used in our approach should reflect each country’s ability to accurately estimate the true IFR.'

Understanding how deadly the virus is can reveal the true number of people who have been infected with the disease through reverse engineering.

For example, if the fatality rate is 1.04 per cent, it means 10.4 die out of every 1,000 who are diagnosed.

Statistics suggest that the true death toll in Britain is currently around 48,417.

Figures from Office for National Statistics, National Records Scotland and NISRA, the Northern Ireland statistics agency, suggest that the true number of people who have died of COVID-19 is 37 per cent higher than the Department of Health has counted.

By May 8 those organisations had recorded 42,862 deaths, while the Department of Health had recorded 31,241 in comparison - a 37 per cent difference.

Applying the same increase to today's death toll of 35,341 puts the current number of victims at 48,417.

If 1.04 per cent is the true death rate the number of people who have died so far suggests that 4.65million people have been infected with the virus.

Studies in other countries, based on surveys in other Western cities of whose blood tests showed that they have had the infection in the past, put the death rate between 0.19 and 0.79.

If those are more accurate, the number of people who have had the infection in the UK varies wildly from a low of 4.65m to a staggering 48.4m, which would be expected if COVID-19 were similar to the flu.

Those calculations work out like this:",15,Low,Right

But a new study suggests that distance might not be far enough to prevent virus transmission, even in light winds.

Researchers found that even in winds of two miles per hour (mph) - the speed needed for smoke to drift through the air - saliva can travel 18 feet in just five seconds.

The team, from the University of Nicosia in Cyprus, says the findings show that the safety distance guidelines may not be doing all that much to prevent us from catching COVID-19, the deadly disease caused by the virus.

A new model from the University of Nicosia in Cyprus has found that infected saliva droplets can travel 18 feet in just five seconds in light 2mph winds (pictured)

Health officials have recommended that people social distance by staying six feet apart to prevent coronavirus from spreading. Pictured: People relax in circles marked on the grass for proper social distancing at Brooklyn's Domino Park, May 18

For the study, published in the journal Physics of Fluid, the team decided to examine how saliva travels through the air.

They created a computer simulation that looks at how every saliva droplet, large and small, moves through the air after a person coughs.

About 3,000 droplets are expelled from single cough, with many of them dispersing in different directions.

From a sneeze, as many as 40,000 droplets might be expelled

Many factors can affect how droplets travel through the air including the size and number of droplets, humidity and how droplets evaporate - all of which were considered in the model.

'Each cell holds information about variables like pressure, fluid velocity, temperature, droplet mass, droplet position, etc,' Dr Talib Dbouk, a senior researcher at the Defense and Security Research Institute at the University of Nicosia.

'The purpose of the mathematical modeling and simulation is to take into account all the real coupling or interaction mechanisms that may take place between the main bulk fluid flow and the saliva droplets, and between the saliva droplets themselves.'

The model ran different equations regarding how far, and how quickly, 1,008 saliva droplets can travel.

Results showed that even in the slightest breeze of 2mph (or 4kph), saliva can travel 18 feet - the length of three refrigerators laying down side by side - in five seconds.

'The droplet cloud will affect both adults and children of different heights,' said Dr Dimitris Draikakis, a professor in the Medical School and the School of Sciences and Engineering at the University of Nicosia.

'Shorter adults and children could be at higher risk if they are located within the trajectory of the traveling saliva droplets.'

For future research, the team plans to study how other things effect saliva traveling through the air such as ground surface temperature and air conditioning.

'This work is vital, because it concerns health and safety distance guidelines, advances the understanding of spreading and transmission of airborne diseases, and helps form precautionary measures based on scientific results,' Drikakis said.

The findings come on the heels of the UK's former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith calling today for the Prime Minister to consider lowering the two-meter rule to 'get the economy moving'.

The MP suggested the UK is the 'only country in Europe' using two-meter distance, with Germany, Poland and the Netherlands practicing separation of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet.

However, this is factually untrue as several European countries are also practicing two-meter social distancing, including Switzerland, Spain and Italy.

Researchers at Mt Sinai University Icahn School of Medicine in New York followed the conditions of 110 hospitalized coronavirus patients and their prior medical records.

Nearly 62 percent of patients with enlarged right ventricles - a chamber of the heart that pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs - died, according to an article that's been accepted to a journal, but not yet published.

It comes as the US coronavirus death toll tops 90,000 and doctors continue to search for clues as to why some patients suffer only minor symptoms and others die of the infection.

Of the 21 patients who died, 41% had enlarged right heart ventricles visible on EKGs (pictured), compared to 11% of patients who died and did not have the heart change, Mt Sinai researchers found in a study of 110 people hospitalized with coronavirus

Of the 110 patients that the Mt Sinai researchers recruited to their study, 21 ultimately died.

Early data out of China suggested that 19 percent of coronavirus patients had heart issues, and it's a trend doctors across the US have since noted too.

So often is the case, that many US doctors are putting coronavirus patients on blood thinners as a matter of course, because many have developed potentially deadly clots.

Doctors closely monitor coronavirus patients for signs that their hearts may be under attack from the coronavirus.

All 110 patients in Mt Sina's study - which has been accepted to the journal JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging, but not yet published - had indicators that suggested their hearts could be struggling and were given echocardiograms (EKGs) to assess their cardiac function.

Thirty percent of the patients given EKGs were already in critical condition, on ventilators to help them breathe.

EKGs revealed that 31 percent of the patients had 'right ventricular dilation,' meaning the lower right chamber of each heart was larger than normal.

Enlarged right ventricles are not typically a sign of heart disease itself. Instead, they usually signal that another condition is stressing the heart.

The patients with enlarged right ventricles were no more likely to have other health conditions, out-of-control inflammation or be on blood thinners than were other patients.

What's more, the researchers did not find higher rates of enlarged left ventricles.

It's not clear exactly why right ventricle, specifically, seemed to suffer more distress.

The research team suspects that multiple factors contribute to the development of the enlarged right chamber, including: low oxygen levels that trigger a tightening of blood vessels, direct damage from the virus, damage from inflammatory immune cells called cytokines and blood clots.

Scientists believe that coronavirus fights its way into human cells by binding to a receptor called ACE2, which is found most prevalently in the lungs, but is also on the surface of blood vessel cells.

Other studies have suggested that the virus's attacks on the blood vessels can lead to all of the conditions that, in turn, the Mt Sinai researcher think contribute to enlargement of the right ventricle.

Forty-one percent of the patients with enlarged right ventricles died of coronavirus, compared to just 11 percent of those whose right ventricles looked normal on the EKG.

EKGs are easy to perform bedside, meaning infected patients don't have to be transported out of their rooms, potentially exposing other patients and more hospital staff, and the new study suggests that performing the imaging exam might help doctors predict when someone with coronavirus is about to take a turn for the worse.",15,Low,Right

None of the 790 people that the patients came into contact with were found to be infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

The team says the findings are a sign that some areas might be safer to reopen than previously believed.

Of the 790 people that about 285 're-infected' coronavirus patients came into contact with, none were found to be infected with the virus. Pictured: People wearing face masks wait to take a test for the new coronavirus at a testing facility in Incheon, South Korea, May 13

Researchers believe the patients were not re-infected but rather they they were shedding dead virus particles. Pictured: Staff at a COVID-19 testing center pass a mouth swab self test kit to a driver at a drive-up testing center in Los Angeles, California, May 14

Researchers also found that the virus samples collected from the patients who tested positive a second time couldn't be grown in lab cultures.

This suggests the patients were not re-infected but rather that they were shedding dead virus particles.

The results are welcome after health authorities in South Korea raised alarms last month upon dozens of recovered patients testing positive for the virus again.

As of Tuesday, more than 400 people have reconfirmed cases of the virus, according to the KCDC.

'We're putting more weight on the theory that dead virus fragments remain in a recovered patient's body, since we haven't seen evidence of infectivity,' Dr Ki Moran, a professor at the National Cancer Center Graduate School, told The Wall Street Journal.

Because of the study's results, South Korean health officials will no longer consider people infectious after they recover from COVID-19.

This means that after recovering or completing an isolation period, resident will not have to test negative for the virus before returning to school or work

'Under the new protocols, no additional tests are required for cases that have been discharged from isolation,' the KCDC wrote in a report, according to Bloomberg.

Cases in which someone has tested positive again will not be referred to as 'PCR re-detected after discharge from isolation.'

The report also found that almost all of the 285 patients had antibodies, which provides more evidence that antibodies provide protection against the virus.

However, it remains unclear how many antibodies one needs to prevent being re-infected and how long they remain in the body.

The findings are not just important to South Korea but across the world, including local and state governments in the US as they grapple with how to safely reopen.

One idea has been to issue 'immunity passports' or 'risk-free certificates' to people who were infected but later tested negative.

But the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against this and said the accuracy of such documents could not be guaranteed.

'Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an 'immunity passport' or 'risk-free certificate' that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection,' the WHO said in a statement.

'There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.'",15,Low,Right

Researchers from Columbia University compiled detailed report on 257 adults hospitalized at two New York City facilities.

Nearly 80 percent of the patients deemed critically ill needed ventilators to keep them breathing and alive, and nearly 40 percent of them had died by the end of the study.

And the organ damage suffered by the hospitalized coronavirus victims went further than their lungs. Nearly a third had such declines in their kidney function that they had to rely on dialysis or similar support.

So far, most studies of critically ill coronavirus patients in the US have been relatively small.

'Although the clinical spectrum of disease has been characterised in reports from China and Italy, until now, detailed understanding of how the virus is affecting critically ill patients in the US has been limited to reports from a small number of cases,' said study co-author Natalie Yip.

In the largest study of hospitalized coronavirus patients in the US to-date, researchers found that 80% of critically ill patients needed ventilators and 40% died. Pictured: a hospital worker tends to a ventilated COVID-19 patient at a New York Veterans Affairs Medical Center (file)

With more than 1.5 million Americans - including over 191,000 in New York City - infected with coronavirus, a surprising amount remains unknown about the virus's exact effects on different populations.

Doctors have been consistently taken aback by the inconsistency in symptoms among coronavirus patients, especially those who fall particularly ill.

The Columbia analysis, published Tuesday in the journal The Lancet, is the latest and largest to attempt to fill in the gaps in that knowledge.

At long last, new daily infections and deaths across the US are slowly declining, but experts in public health officials and epidemiologists, including coronavirus task force member Dr Anthony Fauci, have warned that the virus will likely be with us for years to come.

Its expected persistence means hospitals and doctors need to know what to expect and how best to support the sickest patients.

Although it wasn't designed to work out why some people are more likely to become critically ill with coronavirus, the study found that this was much more common among men, who accounted for 67 percent of hospitalized victims.

Also consistent with previous studies, critically ill patients tended to be older, with an average age of 62.

Younger people were not altogether spared. About one-in-20 wre under 50 years old.

The new study's findings also echoed worrying divisions along racial lines seen in prior studies.

About 20 percent of the critically-ill patients were African American, and nearly two-thirds were Latinx.

It's not exactly clear why minorities in the US are so disproportionately affected by the pandemic, but experts suspect more American minorities are not able to stay home from work to limit their exposures.

Nearly 20 percent of Hispanic and Latin American people and 23 percent of black and African Americans live in poverty, with less leeway to miss work and working in essential services, including health care and sanitation.

Medical risk factors for critical illness included obesity (46 percent), high blood pressure (63 percent) and diabetes (36 percent).

In total, about 80 percent of critically ill patients had at least one chronic illness, leaving them generally less resilient to infection and possibly more vulnerable to dangerous levels of inflammation.

Researchers are coming to understand that coronavirus mounts diffuse attacks throughout the body.

But it most directly targets the lungs, followed by the cardiovascular system.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, the patients most at-risk for life-threatening or deadly coronavirus infections were those with pre-existing pulmonary and heart conditions.

The nation narrowly escaped a disastrous ventilator shortage when many states - especially those hardest hit, like New York - put stay-at-home orders into place.

Still, more than three-quarters of the critically ill patients at included in the study needed to be on ventilators, signalling that the devices will remain crucial supplies for hospitals.

Nearly a third of those critically ill patients needed dialysis to keep their kidneys functioning.

Scientists have recently established that the kidneys themselves have receptors that make them vulnerable to coronavirus infection.

The new study indicates that, in addition to ventilators, hospitals may need to bolster their stocks of dialysis machines until a vaccine is available and the coronavirus pandemic is considered over for good.",15,Low,Right

Agency staff working in multiple homes may have unwittingly infected thousands of elderly and vulnerable residents without being tested for the virus.

In some cases 'bank workers' – used to fill temporary vacancies – were standing in for full-time carers who were self-isolating to protect the residents.

Public Health England researchers analysing the virus' genome traced outbreaks in London care homes back to the temporary workers.

Ministers have had access to the results since at least the end of last month but they were only shared with care home bosses last week, it emerged today.

The government is facing scathing criticism over claims it abandoned care homes in its scramble to protect the NHS from the infection.

Experts estimate 22,000 care home residents in England and Wales alone may have died with coronavirus - but the true scale of the crisis is unknown because of a lack of routine testing.

A care home chief today blamed delayed advice and testing during a 'critical' period for allowing COVID-19 to spread throughout homes.

Researchers at the London School of Economics estimate at least 22,000 care home residents in England and Wales have died with coronavirus

The unpublished PHE study, seen by the Guardian, analysed the behaviour of the virus in six care homes in London from April 11 to April 13, over Easter weekend.

Results of the research were handed to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at the end of last month.

But the findings were only circulated last week to care home providers, councils and local public health directors - fuelling allegations care homes were left in the lurch.

Four in 10 care homes in England have suffered suspected or confirmed coronavirus outbreaks, Number 10 confirms Four out of 10 care homes in England reported outbreaks of coronavirus, according to the Prime Minister's office. A spokesman for Boris Johnson said data currently shows 5,889 care homes have reported a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 outbreak during the pandemic. This amounted to 38 per cent of all the homes in England, he said, and 343 of them had reported cases in the past seven days. Office for National Statistics data shows that more than 12,500 care home residents died with coronavirus in March and April. It is unclear how many people have been infected in homes because they have not been offered routine testing, meaning many have either recovered or died without a test to confirm that they had the virus. The ONS shows that care home residents have made up an increasing proportion of people dying because of the virus as the outbreak has gone on. Overall, around 37 per cent of all the 33,841 COVID-19 deaths recorded in March and April happened in nursing homes. In the week ending May 1, care home deaths accounted for 40 per cent of the total, while hospital deaths made up 53 per cent. Two weeks earlier, however (April 11 to 17) this split was 23 per cent and 70 per cent. And in the week ending April 3, just five per cent of deaths happened in care homes, compared to 89 per cent in hospitals. Advertisement

The study warned: 'Infection is spreading from care home to care home, linked to changed patterns of staffing, working across and moving between homes.'

It said the agency staff were often asymptomatic, which meant 'by the time local health protection teams are informed of an outbreak substantial transmission may already have occurred.'

Care homes were hugely reliant on bank staff at the peak of the crisis in April, when a quarter of the workforce were self-isolating.

Documents seen by the Guardian show that on April 30, DHSC bosses drafted plans to introduce new infection prevention and control measures in care homes.

It followed a surge of 4,300 care home deaths in two weeks in England and Wales and measures included minimising temporary carers' movements between homes.

But these new guidelines were not published until last Thursday – a fortnight later.

DHSC told the newspaper it would not comment on the leaked study, adding that it would be published shortly.

But it claimed that it began drafting new guidance as soon as it received the results from PHE.

'We are working around the clock to make sure care homes, and our frontline social care workforce, are getting the support they need to protect their residents and tackle coronavirus,' a spokesperson said.

'Our help to care homes, which includes financial support, infection control training and supplies of PPE, has meant that two-thirds of England's care homes have had no outbreak at all.'

Barchester Healthcare chief executive Dr Pete Calveley, who said around two thirds of his homes have had COVID-19 cases, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We've had several weeks where their first reaction was to protect the NHS, where they wanted to discharge a lot of clients from hospital to make sure there was capacity for what they anticipated was a surcharge.

'And that meant a lot of people being discharged from care homes rather quickly who hadn't been tested and often we've seen where we've been doing large testing of care homes where asymptomatic staff, and particularly residents, are actually positive and therefore are freely moving through the home are infecting other residents and staff without anybody knowing about it until too late.'

Dr Calveley said there was a 'critical' period of up to four weeks before testing was available and advice was issued for staff to wear professional masks and isolation for new admissions. 'None of that advice came out until it was probably too late,' he said.

Care home deaths of all causes have rocketed during the coronavirus crisis, suggesting even people who aren't killed directly by the illness are suffering

MAJORITY OF COVID-19 CARE HOME VICTIMS DIDN'T MAKE IT TO HOSPITAL The majority of care home residents with COVID-19 die in their care home, with just over one in four dying in hospital, analysis shows. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that just over one in four of all deaths of care home residents in England and Wales between March 2 and May 1 involved COVID-19. From 12,526 coronavirus deaths that happened during that period, 9,039 (72 per cent) occurred within a care home. A further 3,444 (27 per cent) occurred at hospital. The ONS also found that COVID-19 was the leading cause of death for male care home residents in England and Wales during the period, accounting for 30.3 per cent of deaths. It was the second leading cause of death in female care home residents, after dementia and Alzheimer's disease, accounting for 23.5 per cent of deaths. Of all hospital deaths involving COVID-19 during this period, 14.6 per cent were accounted for by care home residents. Source: Press Association

Labour's Liz Kendall, the shadow care secretary, said: 'The prevalence of zero-hours contracts, high vacancy rates and high staff turnover have fuelled the reliance on agency and bank staff with all the problems that brings.

'We need a fundamental rethink of social care as we emerge from this pandemic, and an essential part of this must be to ensure that care workers get the pay, status and career progression this vital sector deserves.'

It comes after it emerged four out of 10 care homes in England reported outbreaks of coronavirus, according to the Prime Minister's office.

A spokesman for Boris Johnson said data currently shows 5,889 care homes have reported a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 outbreak during the pandemic.

This amounted to 38 per cent of all the homes in England, he said, and 343 of them had reported cases in the past seven days.

And in the week ending April 3, just five per cent of deaths happened in care homes, compared to 89 per cent in hospitals.

A care home owner writing in the Sunday Times yesterday said that the NHS had shepherded patients out of hospitals and into care homes without being tested.

Writing anonymously, he said: 'The government was asleep at the wheel. We were sent a public health document on March 13, which said that if any of our residents got significantly ill, they wouldn't allowed into hospital and would ave to die in their home. We'd never read anything like it.

'Elderly people weren't a priority. The government's thinking was: care homes won't be affected.

'But if anything, the war on COVID is happening in care homes, not just the NHS. The government is boasting how it did so well in protecting the NHS, but the reality is deaths in care homes.'

There are around 400,000 people living in care homes around the UK, many of whom have dementia or other debilitating health conditions.

As well as people dying as a direct result of the coronavirus, there are also thousands of 'excess deaths' happening in care homes - those that happen in addition to the average amount that would be expected.

People may be getting less medical care than they usually would, putting their health and lives at risk, experts say.

The Alzheimer's Society last week said there is a 'tragically high' number of people dying in care homes.

Director of research at the charity, Fiona Carragher, said: 'Sadly, devastation continues in care homes with more than three times the usual number of deaths than average reported clearly showing the cost of not putting social care on an equal footing with the NHS.

'We need to know why the death toll in care homes remains so high in addition to coronavirus-reported deaths. 70 per cent of care home residents have dementia and we're deeply concerned that this indicates an increase in deaths due to dementia, caused by isolation and reduction in care workers.

'Each of these deaths is a heart-breaking loss to their friends, families and carers which is why the Government must honour their commitment to ensure care homes get testing for all residents and staff and the protective equipment they need.

'We now approach our third month of lockdown, still with a tragically high number of care home deaths.'",15,Low,Right

Britain today recorded another 545 coronavirus deaths, including a seven-year-old, as the UK's official number of victims rose to 35,341.

It comes as separate grim figures released today by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the UK's true number of COVID-19 victims is at least 44,000 - almost 10,000 higher than the government's official count.

Separate analysis showed the number of excess deaths - which shows how many more people than average have died - across the UK is now close to 55,000 since the crisis began to spiral out of control in March. While the number of people dying has dropped for the third week in a row.

Although deaths are falling, the crisis continues to burn in care homes, figures show. In the first week of May there were a lower than average number of deaths in hospitals, but still around 2,000 'excess' deaths in care homes in England and Wales. Data has shown the peak of the outbreak appears to have come later in nursing homes than in it did in hospitals, and deaths may therefore continue at a higher level for longer.

The Department of Health count only includes patients who have tested positive for the virus, whereas ONS adds patients whose death was suspected to be from the disease.

Figures show the daily deaths are consistently trending downwards - by comparison, there were 627 new fatalities last Tuesday and 693 on the same day the week before.

Officials yesterday declared 160 new deaths, the lowest tally since March 24 - the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the lockdown. However, numbers released on Sundays and Mondays are usually smaller due to a delay in processing over the weekend.

Speaking in today's Downing Street briefing, Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government is now urging people to help work on farms, saying that 'only a third' of the usual fruit and vegetable-picking staff who usually come from abroad have come this year.

Mr Eustice said: 'One thing is clear and that is that this year we will rely on British workers to lend a hand and help to bring that harvest home.'

Professor Angela McLean, chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence, added that it was good news that people were still not using public transport on a large scale.

She said that the numbers of people being admitted to hospital was still falling but was no longer dropping as fast as it was earlier in the outbreak, the reason for which was 'cause for debate'.

Professor McLean said the UK should be 'aiming to emulate' contact tracing success in South Korea, where she said officials are now only diagnosing 'handfuls' of new cases each day, and to scale up its testing operation to be on par with Germany.

Britain's status as the worst-hit country in Europe is underlined by the figures, with Italy so far recording 32,000 deaths, by comparison. Only the US has recorded more deaths, with 90,000 victims.

Hospital deaths have now tapered off so much that the numbers of people dying in hospitals is lower than average for this time of year, for the first time since the lockdown was introduced.

The government said yesterday that there are now fewer than 10,000 people in hospital in England because of the virus.

In care homes, however, there were still more than 2,000 'excess deaths' in the week between May 2 and May 8.

Not all of this will have been caused directly by COVID-19, but they would not have been expected to happen if the pandemic didn't hit Britain.

This shows that the coronavirus outbreak is now mostly persisting mainly in care homes.

ONS data today showed that 9,980 people had died in care homes in England and Wales by May 8, and a further 1,411 happened between then and May 15, according to the Care Quality Commission and Care Inspectorate Wales.

HOPE FOR SUMMER HOLIDAYS AS GREECE BECOMES FIRST COUNTRY TO OFFER TO WAIVE 14-DAY QUARANTINE FOR BRITISH TOURISTS Greece has offered to waive its 14-day coronavirus quarantine for British tourists and holiday firms are planning to restart flights from mid June in what could be a welcome boost for beleaguered lockdown Britain. With the Mediterranean nation's under-pressure economy heavily dependent on holidaymakers it has been making plans to refill deserted beaches and hotels. The country's tourism minister, Harry Theoharis said that it would waive its requirement for visitors if the same was done for Greeks arriving in the UK, speaking to the BBC. It came as ministers mull coronavirus 'air bridges' to allow travellers to move between countries without the need for quarantine once the outbreak is under control. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said a 'blanket' 14-day quarantine rule for arrivals will be introduced from next month. But he disclosed that there are 'active discussions' going on over what countries could be exempted from the regime in future, referring to the idea of 'air bridges' - usually used to refer to military flights over enemy territory. Countries with lower infection levels, such as Australia, New Zealand and Greece, could potentially be excluded from the tough rules, which will be enforced by law. Tui, the largest travel firm in the UK has said it will restart holidays from June 14, with numbers ramped up from July - subject to travel restrictions being relaxed. In further good news for holidaymakers, a senior minister revealed UK campsites could be allowed to reopen from July. Asked about camping, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told Sky: 'Having come from Suffolk down to London, I know there are a lot of campsites that are very keen for people to come. 'Some of this is being carefully considered, recognising that we have a reduced outdoor transmission risk, that things like camping may well become suitable.

This puts the total care home deaths at at least 11,391.

The figure only includes home residents who died in the homes, however, whereas experts say many are taken to hospital before they die, meaning their death is recorded differently and the total is higher.

It was last week predicted to be higher than 12,500 already.

But 343 care homes have announced outbreaks of COVID-19 in the past week, with four out of every 10 in the country saying they have had cases at some point, the Prime Minister's spokesman confirmed.

Officials have come under fire for not offering enough support to care home staff and residents at the beginning of the outbreak.

Bosses say homes were not given enough personal protective equipment, were given hospital patients who hadn't been tested for the virus, and it has now emerged that untested temporary staff may have been inadvertently spreading the illness in the sector's scramble to fill vacancies left by workers in self-isolation.

A Department of Health and Social Care Spokesperson said today: 'Supporting the social care sector throughout this pandemic is a priority.

'We are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need.

'We are ensuring millions of items of PPE are available to care workers, using our increased testing capacity to test care home residents and staff regardless of symptoms and introducing our new £600m Infection Control Fund to help prevent the spread in care homes.'

The statistics announced today showed the number of weekly coronavirus-related deaths in England and Wales has fallen by more than a third in the space of a week.

There were 3,930 deaths registered in the week up to May 8 mentioning 'novel coronavirus' on the death certificate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

These accounted for 31.1 per cent of all deaths during those seven days. It represents a drop of 2,105 deaths (34.8 per cent of the total) from the previous week, when there were 6,035 COVID-19 deaths registered.

The ONS said the early May bank holiday had affected the number of registrations of deaths from all causes, with 88 deaths registered on May 8 compared with 2,950 the previous Friday.

Weekly coronavirus-related deaths in care homes also fell to 1,666 in the week ending May 8.

This is the second weekly fall in a row, down from 2,423 deaths in the previous seven days - a decrease of 31 per cent.

But the proportion of coronavirus deaths taking place in care homes rose, with care home deaths accounting for 42.4 per cent of all the COVID-19 deaths, up from 40 per cent in the week from April 25 to May 1.

Last week, the ONS said more than 12,500 people living in care homes have died with COVID-19, with the majority dying in their care home.

That data included all care home residents who died with coronavirus either at their care home or in hospital.

It suggests the overall care home resident death figure is 25 per cent higher than the total reported by the ONS today.",15,Low,Right

Britons are now being encouraged to wear face masks on public transport and in situations where social distancing is not achievable, such as in shops.

Retailers such as Marks & Spencer and Waitrose have even bought transparent visors for staff to wear in a bid to protect them against COVID-19.

But Professor Linda Bauld, of the University of Edinburgh said the visor may not prevent people from spreading the virus to other people.

While masks are thought to have the opposite benefit - preventing spread but not necessarily infection - Professor Bauld said visors are unlikely to do a good enough job of containing breath droplets exhaled by the wearer.

Face visors are being worn around the world by people trying to protect themselves from the coronavirus, but experts are sceptical that they can stop someone spreading the virus if worn without a mask (Pictured: A security guard in Belgium wearing a visor)

'I don’t think there’s any strong evidence they’re something the public should be wearing on a routine basis,' Professor Bauld told The Guardian.

'The key thing is to cover the mouth and the nose.

'The face coverings that people are being encouraged to use, for example, on public transport is not to protect the wearer, but to protect other people.'

Professor Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, told The Guardian: 'I don’t think there’s any strong evidence they’re something the public should be wearing on a routine basis'

In comparison to face masks, the visor would be intended to stop droplets from breath, coughs or sneezes drifting into the wearer's face, but would be unlikely to stop air coming out of their own nose and mouth.

Masks are such a hot topic because of the way the coronavirus spreads - it infects people by piggy-backing on droplets of moisture which are expelled from people's lungs when they breathe.

These go further if someone coughs or sneezes and, if they're inhaled by someone else, the viruses can latch onto cells in the airways and trigger COVID-19.

Explaining the one-sided benefit of a visor, Professor Bauld added: 'The reason for having a visor which would cover the upper half of your face would be if you’re regularly coming into contact with the public at closer range, and you might be exposed to somebody who is emitting those small droplets that we’re all aware are very efficient at carrying the virus.'

Professor Bauld's comments come after doctors at the University of Iowa last month claimed face shields 'offer a number of advantages' in fighting the pandemic.

In an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), they said: 'Face shields can be reused indefinitely and are easily cleaned with soap and water, or common household disinfectants.

'They are comfortable to wear, protect the portals of viral entry, and reduce the potential for auto-inoculation by preventing the wearer from touching their face.'

'People wearing medical masks often have to remove them to communicate with others around them; this is not necessary with face shields.

WHAT DO EXPERTS SAY ABOUT FACE SHIELDS? In a scramble to find ways to protect people from catching the coronavirus, masks, goggles, visors and gloves have all been touted as possible layers of protection. Some people have even been seen with homemade attempts, such as wearing lunchboxes or water bottles over their faces. But do visors work? Epidemiologist Dr Eli Perencevich and a team of scientists at the University of Iowa said a visor could reduce the amount of virus someone inhaled by up to 92 per cent form 2m away from the source. They said it is unlikely to be possible to do a scientific study fast enough to be useful, and added: 'Face shields... should be included as part of strategies to safely and significantly reduce transmission in the community setting.' Dr Robert Glatter, a doctor at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said: 'While we don't have hard trials or data on the efficacy of face shields at this time, early data from their use in patients with influenza [which is droplet-spread] is promising,' Medical Xpress reported. But research done before the pandemic does not show any clear benefits of using visors on their own, other scientists say. A study named 'Face shields for infection control: A review' by Dr Raymond Roberge at the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) was done in 2016. After looking at evidence from other studies Dr Roberge concluded that face shields have no proof to back up claimed benefits of using them on their own. He said viruses or bacteria could come in through around the edges of the visor and still cause infection. Writing in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene he said: 'Due to the lack of a good facial seal peripherally that can allow for aerosol penetration, face shields should not be used as solitary face/eye protection, but rather as [an addition] to other PPE (protective facemasks, goggles, etc.). 'Given the dearth of available data regarding the appropriate use of face shields for infection control, scientifically sound research needs to be conducted on the use of this form of PPE.'

'The use of a face shield is also a reminder to maintain social distancing, but allows visibility of facial expressions and lip movements for speech perception.'

The piece, authored by Iowa's Dr Eli Perencevich, said that shields 'appear to significantly reduce the amount of virus' inhaled.

Some research has shown that people are at risk of becoming more seriously ill with COVID-19 if they receive a larger 'viral load' - the first dose of viruses that they are infected with.

Dr Perencevich and colleagues pointed to a study that simulated how much of a flu virus a healthcare worker wearing a visor would have been exposed to.

Results showed they inhaled around 92 per cent less of the virus when standing 2m away - the strict social distancing advice.

But the same study revealed shields were less effective after 30 minutes, when the particles had dispersed into the surrounding room.

Dr Perencevich and colleagues added that 'major policy recommendations should be evaluated using clinical studies'.

But they said: 'It is unlikely a randomized trial of face shields could be completed in time to verify efficacy.

'No clinical trial has been conducted to assess the efficacy of widespread testing and contact tracing, but that approach is based on years of experience.

'Face shields... should be included as part of strategies to safely and significantly reduce transmission in the community setting.'

Tech giant Apple last month announced it was going to begin producing its own face shields for medical workers battling the pandemic.

Chief executive Tim Cook said it had also designed its own transparent protective visor and begun mass production at its factories in the US and China.

Last week Apple revealed it plans to sell them to the public soon and that it would sell shields at cost, meaning it won't make a profit off of them.

British chocolate giant Cadbury has also started to make visors, teaming up with engineering firm 3P Innovation to produce thousands of the gadgets.

The visors will be made through 3D printing technology, which is normally used to make chocolate sculptures at the chocolatier's factory in Bournville.

Frontline NHS workers, including nurses treating coronavirus patients in intensive care, are told to wear visors.

Medics are also instructed to wear shields during aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubating a patient.

If in 'extremely short supply', medics are urged to re-use single-use visors. They must cover the forehead, extend below the chin and wrap around the face.

They should be cleaned using a detergent - the same decontamination process used for any bit of PPE that needs to be donned again.

Visors will degrade with repeated cleaning, according to the guidance, which says they should be 'resupplied regularly'.

Waitrose announced it had ordered protective visors at the end of March, revealing staff could wear them at work if they wanted to stay safe.

Marks and Spencer followed suit weeks later and gave front-line employees plastic face shields, to protect them against COVID-19.

And Co-op introduced visors earlier this month, giving thousands of staff the option to wear the gadgets during their shift if they wanted.

It comes after a study last week found men are less likely to wear face masks than women because they are seen as 'not cool' and 'a sign of weakness'.

Experts surveyed nearly 2,500 US adults, finding that men were more likely to see face masks as being 'shameful' and be put off by the perceived stigma.

Eight per cent of men and five per cent of women said they would definitely not be wearing a face mask when outside of their homes.",15,Low,Right

Experts analysing the pandemic found many outbreaks of COVID-19 infections can be blamed on so-called 'super-spreading' events.

One of the best examples of this, they said, is a choir rehearsal in Washington State where 87 per cent of the 61 singers ended up with the infection.

Scientists at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine say, in most cases, these outbreaks are traced back to a singular highly infectious person.

Around one in ten people who get the virus are so-called 'super-spreaders' because they are very infectious and pass the coronavirus on to lots of people.

The majority of COVID-19 cases, around 80 per cent, are caused by this small group of highly infectious people.

The researchers said the focus of controlling the epidemic should be to limit events where super-spreaders could wreak havoc.

Super-spreading is known to occur in care homes, hospitals and religious places - but the scientists say other unusual events can lead to clusters of cases.

Choirs, gym classes and business conferences and other 'superspreader events' may be responsible for most coronavirus cases, scientists say (stock)

Gyms lend themselves as the perfect place for the virus to spread, due to the setting and because there are many people (stock)

The research by LSHTM and the Alan Turing Institute suggests there is variability in the number of people that an individual passes the virus on to.

They applied a mathematical model to outbreaks in various countries and published their findings in Wellcome Open Research.

The findings show that around 80 per cent of COVID-19 transmission was caused by a very small number of individuals.

These people make up around ten per cent of all infected patients, therefore their attack rate is very high. They may be called 'super spreaders'.

The other 90 per cent of individuals are responsible for the remaining 20 per cent of COVID-19 transmission.

But one of the authors of the paper, Dr Adam Kucharski, told MailOnline that super-spreader events are not just due to people but also the environment.

He said: 'We should be cautious about assuming there are a few specific people that always drive transmission.

'It’s likely that events and environments are more important than specific individuals. It’s probably more a case of ""super-settings"" than ""super-spreaders"".'

SHOULD THE TWO METRE SAFE DISTANCE BE DITCHED? A former Conservative Party leader has called on the Prime Minister to reconsider the two-metre social distancing rule to 'get the economy moving'. Iain Duncan Smith said the UK is the 'only country in Europe' using the measure, with Germany using 1.5 metres and France and Italy using only one metre. Current government guidance stipulates that you be be two metres apart from anyone not in your household. But the distance differs from advice given by the World Health Organisation. The guidance on the website says: 'Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. ' The reason for this as stated on its website is that: 'When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.' The two metre rule can be traced back to research in the 1930s that showed droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes would land within a one-two metre range, as reported by the BBC. Iain Duncan Smith is not the first to criticise the UK's adopting of the two metre rule, out of line with many other European countries. Robert Dingwall, from the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), previously said in April the rule was 'conjured up out of nowhere'. Mr Dingwall told Radio 4's Today: 'We cannot sustain [social distancing measures] without causing serious damage to society, to the economy and to the physical and mental health of the population. 'I think it will be much harder to get compliance with some of the measures that really do not have an evidence base. I mean the two-metre rule was conjured up out of nowhere.' Advertisement

The study suggests the reproduction number - the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected person - can be reduced by focusing not on the population as a whole but super-spreader events.

Dr Kucharski said: 'We’ve known super-spreading events are important for other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, and this initial analysis suggests they are similarly important for COVID-19.'

The LSHTM researchers wrote in their paper: 'As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare super-spreading events.'

Super-spreader events have been pinpointed to choirs on a number of occasions.

The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported a large outbreak that was the result of a choir rehearsal in Washington State on March 10.

Some 61 of the choir’s members attended the rehearsal, and one person had 'cold like' symptoms at the time. They later tested positive for COVID-19.

The rehearsal lasted for two-and-a-half hours, with attendees reportedly taking precautions not to mingle too much because they were aware the virus was already in the US.

Ultimately, an estimated 87 per cent of attendees later got sick. This includes 32 confirmed cases and 20 probable. Two people died.

The CDC report said the singing practice provided ample opportunity for droplets transmission.

But the singers would also have been chatting closely in breaks, sharing snacks and stacking chairs at the end of practice.

In Amsterdam, 102 of 130 choir members became sick with COVID-19 days after their last performance on March 8 before the lockdown in The Netherlands.

During the course of the pandemic, a number of outbreaks have been traced back to a business conference attended by hundreds of people.

For example, a biotech conference held between February 26 and 27 led to the spread of coronavirus from Massachusetts to Indiana, Tennessee, North Carolina and even Europe.

The official number of people who got sick due to that conference held by Biogen was 99, all stemming from a couple of senior executives who did not known they had the virus.

One of Britain's first coronavirus cases was as a result of a conference held in Singapore.

The man, Steve Walsh, from Hove, was one of 104 attendees at a conference at the Grand Hyatt Singapore hotel on Jan 20-22.

At the time, it was reported at least four people in Singapore, three Asian businessmen, a Malaysian man and two South Koreans had been diagnosed with the virus after returning from the conference.

Mr Walsh went on to travel to a chalet in the French Alps, which led to a further 11 people falling ill, technically becoming a 'superspreader' himself.

The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported a large outbreak that was the result of a choir rehearsal in Washington State. Some 52 people became sick as a result of one index case (pictured). A total of 61 people attended the rehearsal

One of the authors of the paper, Adam Kucharski, told MailOnline: 'It’s likely that events and environments are more important than specific individuals. It’s probably more a case of ""super-settings"" than ""super-spreaders""'

Gyms also lend themselves as the perfect place for the virus to spread, due to the setting and because there are many people.

A dance class in South Korea is an example of this, being linked to 112 cases of COVID-19.

Researchers who investigated the outbreak said it started with 27 gym instructors who attended a workshop, in which they learned routines for four hours.

Eight of them later tested positive for COVID-19.

But before that, while they had mild symptoms, they had taught classes across 12 different gyms a week after the workshop.

All together, 54 students out of 217 developed COVID-19 from the instructors - an attack rate of 23 per cent. Family members went on to catch the virus from the students.

The authors wrote in Emerging Infectious Diseases: 'Characteristics that might have led to transmission from the instructors... include large class sizes, small spaces, and intensity of the workouts.

'The moist, warm atmosphere in a sports facility coupled with turbulent air flow generated by intense physical exercise can cause more dense transmission of isolated droplets.'

Nightclubs and packed markets are also examples of where a COVID-19 'superspreader' event could occur.

A popular ski resort with party goers, known as 'Ibiza of the Alps' has been at the centre of attention amid Europe's coronavirus crisis.

The resort of Ischgl in the Tyrolean Alps has hundreds of tourists from across Europe in February half term. They piled into bars such as Kitzloch.

In April, Austria's public health agency said that Ischgl was the source of the country's biggest cluster of coronavirus cases, infecting more than 800 Austrians.

Up to twice as many people from abroad fell ill, particularly in Germany and Scandinavian countries, as well as Britain.

Marketplaces have also been implicated in some outbreaks.

Peruvian police closed a busy food market in the capital Lima after mass rapid testing confirmed more than 160 of its traders had tested positive for COVID-19 in April.

I don’t know how many yet, or who they are, or when they will die, but the one absolute certainty from his public boast that he’s taking hydroxychloroquine is it will cost lives.

Some people will now take it who shouldn’t.

And some people won’t be able to take it who should.

When Trump previously touted the benefits of using disinfectant in the body, I ripped into him for spreading ‘batsh*t crazy’ ideas for a cure during a global pandemic and told him to ‘shut the f*ck up’.

It wasn’t nice language but then this isn’t a very nice situation, is it?

More than 90,000 people in America have now died from coronavirus, by far the worst death toll in the world. Each one of those people left a family mourning the loss of a grandparent, parent, sibling or child.

Speaking at the White house during an event with restaurant workers, Trump suddenly announced to the media that he’s been taking hydroxychloroquine for the past fortnight

The Food and Drug Administration warned in April, after Trump first aired his enthusiasm for it, that hydroxychloroquine can significantly increase the risk of death in people, especially those with heart problems, and cautioned against its use

Trump responded to my critique by unfollowing me on Twitter, cancelling his chaotic self-aggrandizing daily news briefings, and avoiding spewing more insane ‘cures’.

So, he didn’t like my advice, but appeared to take it.

Now, sadly, Dr Trump – a man with all the certainty of Dr House but none of the medical training - is back spewing his dangerous half-baked medical claptrap.

Speaking at the White house during an event with restaurant workers, he suddenly announced to the media that he’s been taking hydroxychloroquine for the past fortnight.

This is a drug normally used to treat people with malaria, or conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

But it’s not recommended for use in relation to COVID-19.

The Food and Drug Administration warned in April, after Trump first aired his enthusiasm for it, that hydroxychloroquine can significantly increase the risk of death in people, especially those with heart problems, and cautioned against its use.

‘Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19,’ the FDA declared.

It was supported by the British Medical Journal which published a study of 150 patients this month that found the drug didn’t significantly improve outcomes for coronavirus patients but did induce potentially serious side effects in a third of those who took it.

The FDA is the US Government’s own public health agency.

Dr. Sean Conley, the White House physician, released a memo Monday night, saying he and Trump discussed the matter and believed the benefits of using hydroxychloroquine outweighed its risk factors

Yet the President has now directly defied its specific advice.

And he’s also ignored America’s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci who said last week: ‘We need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.’

By doing this, Trump has effectively told 320 million Americans to ignore the expert warnings about hydroxychloroquine too.

As with his insane theory that disinfectant should be put inside the body to fight coronavirus – one that led to an immediate spike in people using disinfectant and calling health helplines with serious side effects – it’s hard to think of a more staggeringly irresponsible thing for a President to do.

Yet it’s entirely in keeping with Trump’s whole dangerously erratic behavioral pattern throughout this crisis.

First, he constantly tried to dismiss the coronavirus as nothing much to worry about, assuring us it would disappear ‘like a miracle’.

Then, when it began to spread in America, he constantly insisted he had it all under control.

Then, as it spiraled out of control, and the US death toll surged, he constantly changed the goalposts of what number of deaths would constitute ‘success’.

Then, as the US economy tanked, Trump actively encouraged Americans to defy his own administration’s guidance and break the lockdown and social-distancing rules designed to save their lives – a decision that will lead to many more infections and deaths.

Trump has ignored America’s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci who said last week: ‘We need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes’

Now as America’s cases and deaths continue to soar - Trump even ludicrously moaned that the more coronavirus tests were done, the more cases were found, inferring the testing should stop to make him look better - he’s reduced to distracting everyone’s attention from the horrifying loss of life by flouting insane medical theories about how to beat the virus.

Last night’s hydroxychloroquine revelation was so shockingly bad that even anchors from the largely pro-Trump Fox News network moved quickly to plead with viewers not to do what their President is doing.

‘If you are in a risky population here,’ said Neil Cavuto, ‘and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus, or in a worse-case scenario you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you. I cannot stress enough. This will KILL you.’

It was one of the most startling moments of television I’ve ever watched, and it was followed by the extraordinary spectacle of Nancy Pelosi, his most bitter rival, pleading with Trump to stop taking the drug because she doesn’t want him to die.

Let’s be very clear: there is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can prevent you from being infected by COVID-19. None.

Nor is there any proven evidence it can be used to treat COVID patients in a significantly beneficial way.

A trial in China established it did not speed up the recovery of any patients.

And New York researchers last week said patients in its studies got no benefits from the drug.

So, there is no demonstrable upside for anyone to take it in relation to coronavirus.

But there is a big potential downside.

Leading doctors have warned of serious side effects including arrhythmia, a condition that throws off the process that makes the heart beat in time.

One trial in Brazil actually had to be stopped because so many of the enrolled coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine developed this very issue.

Harvard scientists reported in a separate review of 10 studies that it may even impair the ability of patients’ immune systems to fight off the virus.

Even anchors from the largely pro-Trump Fox News network moved quickly to plead with viewers not to do what their President is doing. ‘If you are in a risky population here,’ said Neil Cavuto, ‘and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus, or in a worse-case scenario you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you. I cannot stress enough. This will KILL you’

It was followed by the extraordinary spectacle of Nancy Pelosi, his most bitter rival, pleading with Trump to stop taking the drug because she doesn’t want him to die

And a study of hundreds of patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centers found that those treated with hydroxychloroquine had much higher death rates than those who weren’t.

It wasn’t even close: the 97 patients who took it had a 27.8% mortality rate compared to 11.4% of the 158 patients who didn’t.

The conclusion from all this is obvious: hydroxychloroquine, for some people, can be a killer.

That’s why it is so vitally important that only those who absolutely need it, for things like malaria, are prescribed it.

Yet now the President of the United States has said he’s taking it to ward off coronavirus, many millions of people around the world will think they should be too.

That, as I said at the start of this column, will inevitably mean some will take it for COVID-19 who shouldn’t, and it will kill them.

And it also means that some others who desperately need it, to repel other illnesses, will inevitably not be able to get their usual supply due to massive increased demand, so it will kill them too.

Either way, people will die because President Trump has once again decided he knows better than the science and medical experts.

It’s a disgraceful abuse of his power and position, and a woefully negligent act for any leader to take during the world’s worst health crisis in 100 years.

‘I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this, when I announced this,’ Trump told reporters excitedly.

They did indeed light up, in the same way that mine did when I heard what he’d said: with utter horror.

Shame on you, Mr President.",15,Low,Right

In the latest animal trials of the vaccine carried out on rhesus macaques, all six of the participating monkeys went on to catch the coronavirus.

Dr William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor, revealed the monkeys who received the vaccine had the same amount of virus in their noses as the three non-vaccinated monkeys in the trial.

This suggests the treatment, which has already received in the region of £90million in government investment, may not halt the spread of the deadly disease.

The bombshell comes after initial reports last week suggested the vaccine offered 'some' immunity against the virus, and stopped it getting deep into the lungs, where it becomes deadly.

The vaccine, known as ChAdOx1 nCov-19, is currently undergoing its first human clinical trial, as nations accelerate their efforts to tackle the deadly virus.

It is the latest setback to hopes of a cure after a professor at Imperial College London, where researchers are also studying a potential vaccine, warned earlier today a working vaccine is unlikely to be ready this year.

He said people should not have 'false expectations' of cure being ready soon despite ministers revealing they are hoping to have 30 million vaccine doses for the UK by September.

A coronavirus vaccine developed in Britain may not stop those treated being infected. Pictured: A volunteer is injected with the vaccine in Oxford University's vaccine trial

Discussing the Oxford vaccine, Dr Haseltine wrote on Forbes: 'All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged.

'There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from (nasal secretions) in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals.

'Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected.'

Professor of Molecular Biology at Nottingham University, John Ball, warned: 'The amount of virus genome detected in the noses of the vaccinated and un-vaccinated monkeys was the same and this is concerning.

'If this represents infectious virus and a similar thing occurs in humans, then vaccinated people can still be infected and shed large amounts of virus.

'This could potentially spread to others in the community.'

Professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at Edinburgh University Eleanor Riley said the number of antibodies produced was 'insufficient' to prevent infection and viral shedding.

'If similar results were obtained in humans, the vaccine would likely provide partial protection against disease in the recipient but would be unlikely to reduce transmission in the wider community,' she said.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma yesterday announced a deal between Oxford University and AstraZeneca which could see millions of vaccines available in the UK by September

The vaccine' limitations were revealed when the full trial results were published last week.

They also show three of the six vaccinated monkeys began breathing more rapidly than normal after becoming infected, making them clinically ill.

However, none developed damage to the lungs. This was seen in two of the monkeys that did not get the vaccine.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VACCINES CREATED BY OXFORD AND IMPERIAL COLLEGE? The science behind both vaccine attempts hinges on recreating the 'spike' proteins that are found all over the outside of the COVID-19 viruses. Both will attempt to recreate or mimic these spikes inside the body. The difference between the two is how they achieve this effect. Imperial College London will try to deliver genetic material (RNA) from the coronavirus which programs cells inside the patient's body to recreate the spike proteins. It will transport the RNA inside liquid droplets injected into the bloodstream. The team at the University of Oxford, on the other hand, will genetically engineer a virus to look like the coronavirus - to have the same spike proteins on the outside - but be unable to cause any infection inside a person. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. If the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person's bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future. The same process is thought to happen in people who catch COVID-19 for real, but this is far more dangerous - a vaccine will have the same end-point but without causing illness in the process.

Dr Haseltine added: 'It is crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilising immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine.

'It may provide partial protection.'

The vaccine entered its first human clinical trial last month. As many as 1,110 people across Oxford, Southampton, London and Bristol are taking part. Half are receiving the vaccine while the others are given a control.

The government announced a further £65.5million investment in the Oxford vaccine trials yesterday.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the Government is hoping to be in a position to roll-out a mass vaccination programme in the Autumn of this year.

Mr Sharma praised the Oxford vaccine and said: 'The speed with which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.

'This new money will help mass produce the Oxford vaccine so that if current trials are successful we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.

'The UK will be the first to get access and we can also ensure that in addition to supporting people here, we are able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost.'

Imperial College London is also working on a vaccine to stop coronavirus, which it says aims to trigger a rapid immune response using the 'spike' protein on the virus surface.

It has received more than £20 million in funding so far.

However, Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial, said it is 'important not to have a false expectation that it is just around the corner'.

Prof Shattock said there are an estimated 100 coronavirus vaccines in development around the world.

But the 'most optimistic estimation' would suggest that one proven to be successful will not be 'readily available for wide scale use into the beginning of next year'.

He said it 'may take quite some time' for researchers to get all the data they need to prove without doubt that a vaccine actually works.

Imperial's Professor Robin Shattock today said it 'may take quite some time' for researchers to develop a working vaccine

Asked if the UK is 'on the brink' of getting a working vaccine, Prof Shattock told the BBC: 'I think we need to distinguish two different things. One of the hurdles is making vaccine doses, obviously AstraZeneca can do that and that is a good thing but that is very different to having the data that proves that the vaccine actually works.

'We need to have those data to show that it is ready and appropriate to roll out. It may take quite some time to get that data, it is a numbers game.

US firm Moderna's experimental vaccine shows potential to block coronavirus in human trials Moderna's experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced antibodies that could 'neutralize' the new coronavirus in patients in a small early stage clinical trial, the company announced Monday, sending its shares up by more than 20 percent. The levels of the antibodies - immune cells made in response to a germ, which may provide protection against reinfection - were similar to those in blood samples of people who have recovered from COVID-19, early results from the study conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) showed. Participants were given three different doses of the vaccine and Moderna said it saw dose-dependent increase in immunogenicity, the ability to provoke an immune response in the body. Moderna noted that the early trial is intended to determine the safety and side effects of the vaccine and, although the early results are promising, it's too soon to say whether the shot candidate can actually block the virus. The company has been in the lead of the US race to make a COVID-19 vaccine, and nearly neck-in-neck with an Oxford University effort to make one in the UK.

'And in fact as we are better at reducing the number of infections in the UK it gets much harder to test whether the vaccine works or not.

'There are no certainties, no guarantees in developing any of these candidates so I think it is important not to have a false expectation that it is just around the corner.

'It may be longer than any of us would want to think.'

Some health experts have suggested a vaccine could take as long as 18 months to develop while others have cautioned one may never be found.

Prof Shattock said: 'I think we need to keep context here. Obviously there could be some success, we could see things working earlier if we get the numbers and the kind of AstraZeneca approach is preparing for that success.

'But it is probably very likely that we won't really get the evidence until into early next year and then there is a difference between a solution in the UK which could be rolled out and a global solution.

'A global solution is likely to take much longer just because of the sheer operational effort to make billions of doses and make them available worldwide.'

Prof Shattock said he believed there is a 'very high chance of seeing a number of vaccines that work' as he said the evidence suggested coronavirus is 'not such a hard target as others'.

He added: 'My gut feeling is that we will start to see a number of candidates coming through with good evidence early towards next year - possibly something this year.

'But they won't be readily available for wide scale use into the beginning of next year as the kind of most optimistic estimation.'

Six drugs for treating coronavirus are currently in clinical trials worldwide.

China has four potential vaccines in clinical trials at present, three of which have entered stage two.

Trials of one vaccine developed by Beijing-based company Sinovac Biotech in April appeared to arrest the development of Covid-19 in monkeys.

However, it used a Sars-Cov-2 virus, whereas the Oxford vaccine uses a weakened version of adenovirus (common cold) that causes infections in chimpanzees, with the coronavirus spike protein added to it.

Sinovac Biotech has secured land and loans for it to develop a facility to mass produce any effective vaccine.

'That's not a good idea,' says Dr Andrew Preston, a reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath. 'It is good practice to keep food preparation surfaces as clean as possible, which means avoiding placing unnecessary objects on them, particularly those that have been outside.

'It is a good idea to try to separate items you take with you when going out, and those you use often inside the home, to reduce the risk of contamination.

'Put shopping bags on the floor rather than on other surfaces, too.'

Can I catch the coronavirus from over the garden fence?

'A typical, solid, 6ft-high fence will provide a physical barrier between you and your neighbour, which will block contaminated droplets from passing between you,' says Dr Preston.

'However, it is still advisable to keep a two-metre distance between you, rather than standing right next to the fence. If the fence is lower, social distancing is even more important.'

Once lockdown ends, do we still need to disinfect everything? (file image)

Once lockdown ends, do we still need to disinfect everything?

'Although some restrictions are being lifted, Covid-19 remains present and will be so for some time to come,' says Dr Preston.

'Precautions against exposure to the virus — regular handwashing, social distancing and disinfecting surfaces — should be continued until we can be sure the virus has been eradicated, or a successful vaccine has been rolled out and people are protected.'

After falling during my daily exercise, a passer-by helped me back on to my feet — but, in doing so, we were closer than two metres apart. What should we have done?

'Depending on your level of interaction, the risk should have been low,' says Dr Preston. 'If the kind person simply helped you back to your feet, the contact would have been very brief.

'Should this happen again, avoid being face-to-face to reduce the risk of passing on contaminated droplets, and as soon as possible retreat to being two metres apart.

'It is still possible to ask someone if they need help. If help is required, then cover your nose and mouth with a mask if you have one, or use your arm as a shield.'

How will I know when it is safe to visit my new grandson to give him a cuddle? I am 74 and in good health (file image)

How will I know when it is safe to visit my new grandson to give him a cuddle? I am 74 and in good health.

'There is no way of knowing whether you or your grandson have the virus so, unfortunately, there remains a risk from different households mixing,' says Dr Preston.

'Although you are in good health, your age places you at greater risk of suffering severe symptoms should you contract Covid-19 and, while children appear to experience less severe symptoms, a newborn would be considered vulnerable.

'So, for now — as frustrating as it may be — you should avoid close interactions with others, including your new grandson.

'The Government will issue more guidance on families mixing over the coming months.'

The government has advised people to wear non-surgical face coverings while out in public

How will I know if sneezing, coughing and itchy eyes are hay fever or Covid-19?

'It's impossible to know whether a sneeze or a cough is due to hay fever or Covid-19 — so it is wise to stay vigilant, keep your distance from others and wash your hands regularly,' says Professor Gino Martini, chief scientist at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

'If you suffer from hay fever, you can take antihistamines, which will make symptoms more manageable. A hay fever sufferer who has Covid-19 can transmit the virus if they sneeze and cough, so they should stay at home, sneeze into a tissue, and wear a face covering where possible.'

I have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung condition that causes breathing difficulties. Is it safe for me to have a blood test?

'Most hospitals and GP practices have separated their Covid-19 activities from others, to shield non-Covid patients from the risk of infection,' says Dr Preston.

'Contact the centre where your blood test is scheduled to discuss your concern.'

Once the epidemic is over, is it possible it could start all over again?

'Yes, a second wave is a real possibility,' says Dr Preston. 'The current epidemic will eventually subside, largely due to reduced social contact, but it is not clear whether it will diminish to the point of the virus disappearing, or whether the virus will continue to circulate for years, like flu.

'At present, we know transmission is occurring as we are still seeing new cases each day. As people return to workplaces and start socialising again, it is quite likely that the number of cases will increase. The question is how large this increase will be, and whether measures aimed at identifying and isolating cases can stop another exponential rise, and potentially another lockdown.'

Can Covid-19 be passed through plants?

'The coronavirus cannot infect plants, so it cannot 'live' in plants,' says Dr Preston. 'However, it is possible that the virus can survive on their leaves and stems for short periods.

'When outside, avoid touching your face, and wash your hands when you get home.'

I live by the sea where it is often windy. Does this put me at greater risk?

'In theory, winds can move particles over a greater distance than still air, but wind will also disperse any virus-containing aerosol,' says Dr Preston. 'As long as you are following the social distancing rules, being in a windy town doesn't pose any greater risk.'

I live by the sea where it is often windy. Does this put me at greater risk? (file image)

Is the only way out of this pandemic to give everyone an antibody test?

'Antibody tests can tell you if you've had the virus,' says Dr Preston. 'But we don't yet know if having antibodies makes you immune; we suspect it provides some protection.

'Evidence suggests that relatively few people have had the virus, so testing everyone won't solve the problem of how we get back to normal activities.

'Vaccination is our best hope in the longer term.'

Is it safe to wear a face mask if you have asthma?

'Wearing a mask means the air you breathe is warmer and contains more moisture,' says Dr Andrew Whittamore, clinical lead for the charity Asthma UK.

'For some people with asthma, this could trigger symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath, as the warmer, wetter air can irritate the respiratory tract. However, it will vary from person to person.

'Try to find a mask that works for you and practise wearing it to see if it does exacerbate your symptoms.

'The Government advice is that they are not compulsory but advisable.'

According to AdventHealth, it was concerned with one of of its third-party labs, MicroGen DX, which had been processing the tests.

The group says scores of patients likely received false positive or negative results. Meanwhile, thousands went at least two weeks without getting results back.

Due the lab being unable to fulfill its obligations and 'unacceptable delays', AdventHealth has terminated its contract with the lab.

The company says it will notify the patients who are impacted with a letter and a phone call - but many Floridians say no one has reached out to them yet.

AdventHealth says the results of 35,000 coronavirus tests administered in Florida are 'unreliable'. Pictured: Cars arrive at a drive-thru coronavirus testing site at a parking lot in Tampa, April 22

The third-party laboratory that was processing the results says the fault is the federal government's for taking supplies and redirecting them to other labs. Pictured: Healthcare workers tend to a patient at the AdventHealth COVID-19 testing site in Daytona Beach, April 10

'While we work successfully with many other labs across multiple states to provide COVID-19 tests for our communities, we have terminated our contract with this particular lab and share in the disappointment and frustration this situation has created,' Terry Shaw, president and CEO of AdventHealth, wrote in a statement.

'We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and uncertainty it has caused.'

One of the Floridians who never got her coronavirus tests results back is Tanya Rezak, from Orlando.

She told DailyMail.com she had been experiencing upper respiratory symptoms for a few weeks and decided to get tested to rule out the virus.

Rezak signed up for a test and she was directed to a drive-thru clinic on May 5, and was 'in and out' very quickly.

Five days later, there were no results AdventHealth's app and she hadn't gotten a phone call

WHAT ADVENTHEALTH IS SAYING TO DO IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE 35,000 PEOPLE AFFECTED If you received a positive COVID-19 result, you need to be retested If you received a negative COVID-19 result, but have symptoms, you need to seek care and may need to be retested If you received a negative COVID-19 result and have no symptoms, you may ask to be retested pending availability If you were tested but haven't received results yet, they will not be processed. AdventHealth has asked that all unprocessed samples be destroyed Advertisement

'I called their COVID hotline and they said lab backlog and I would have to wait an additional week,' Rezack, 47, said.

'After the week, I called the COVID hotline again. They said the lab was backlogged and would expedite delivery of my results and said they would call me within 48 hours.'

After 48 hours went by with no phone call, Rezak took to Twitter to express her frustration. That's when she learned she wouldn't be getting her results back.

'We've been made aware the third-party lab we contracted with is unable to process COVID-19 tests,' the lab wrote back on Twitter.

Rezak was shocked.

'Responding to this on Twitter, I felt, was very unprofessional,' she said. 'They had broken my trust in their organization'

Rick Martin, CEO of MicroGen DX, whose lab is based in Texas, said the issue with not processing results quickly results was the fault of the federal government.

'The government basically has taken control of inventories of lab supplies,' Martin told WFTV.

'We had ordered extraction machines and a disposable device that’s used on the extraction machines. We had ordered them months ago and all our orders were taken from us and redirected to other labs.'

Martin says he stands by his lab and the test results that did come back, but AdventHealth has since terminated its contact with the lab.

'I didn't learn anything except it's a sad mess in a time we need results quickly to be healthy as a community,' Rezak said.

'They need to understand lives are at stake... All along the line I've seen failure.'

She has since gotten a second coronavirus test from OrlandoHealth, with results expected to return in 24 to 48 hours.

As of Monday morning 658,000 people in Florida - three percent of the population - have been tested for the virus, according to the state's health department.

So far, 45,208 people have tested positive and 1,997 people have died.

For the last three years, about two thirds of five-month-olds in the state have been up-to-date on their shots. But as of May 2020, only 49.7 percent of children in that age group had their recommended vaccinations - a decline of more than 25 percent.

Vaccination rates declined among other age groups, too, although by a smaller margin. Collectively, the number of kids 18 and under who got shots declined 21.5 percent this year compared to previous ones.

The researchers only examined data on Michigan, but anti-vaccination rallies have persisted even as coronavirus shut down much of the country and Americans have shied away from hospitals and doctors' offices for fear they'll be exposed to the virus.

No vaccine yet exists to protect against coronavirus, but the pandemic hit just as the US had gotten a spate of measles outbreaks under control - and the CDC researchers warn that falling vaccination rates could open the door to another one.

Fewer than 50% of five-month-old children in Michigan got their recommended vaccines this year, CDC research revealed (file)

Controlling the spread of coronavirus became priority number one in the US and around the world - but measures to stem its rapid transmission came with collateral damage for other parts of the healthcare system.

On March 13, the pandemic was declared a national state of emergency in the US.

By March 25, the CDC had recommended that US hospitals cancel or postpone all non-emergency surgeries and procedures.

Although hospitals were not fully or formally shut down, the public was generally encouraged to avoid them if possible to protect themselves and healthcare workers from potential exposure to coronavirus, to free up staff availability for COVID-19 patients, and to help prevent the health care system from becoming overwhelmed.

There was bound to be fallout for other facet of public health, and the earliest studies are just beginning to paint a picture of those consequences.

Coronavirus infection rates have been generally low among children - although a spike in pediatric cases coinciding with a rare and dangerous inflammatory condition proves they're not entirely safe from coronavirus - but that doesn't mean that the pandemic hasn't had other effects on them.

Regular check ups and vaccination are core to pediatric health care, but the new research from the CDC suggests this priority has been set aside since the pandemic began.

With the exception of shots given at birth, vaccine rates fell for every age group in Michigan in 2020 compared to previous years, as the coronavirus pandemic made families shy of health care facilities

Researchers looked at vaccination data on 9,269 children from 2016 to 2019 and 9,539 children from this year, all in Michigan, which has the nation's seventh largest coronavirus outbreak currently.

According to CDC recommendations, ages one, three, five, seven, 16, 19 and 24 are 'vaccine milestone' markers for kids.

With the exception of hepatitis B shots typically given at birth, at a hospital, vaccination rates fell for all ages and types of shots.

In past years, two thirds of five-month-old children were up-to-date on their vaccines.

But this year, only 49.7 percent had gotten all the recommended shots by May.

For all other children under 18, vaccination rates fell 21.5 percent and by 15.5 percent for toddlers two and under.

By the time children are 16 months old, they should have had their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

Last May, 76.1 percent of kids had gotten the shot.

In May 2020, that rate fell below 71 percent.

It's a difference of less than seven percent - but even that relatively small decline introduces weakness into the shield of herd immunity.

'The observed declines in vaccination coverage might leave young children and communities vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles,' the study authors wrote.

'If measles vaccination coverage of 90%–95% (the level needed to establish herd immunity) is not achieved, measles outbreaks can occur.'

At just over three quarters of 16-month-old kids, Michigan's 2019 measles vaccination rates were already well below the level required to confer herd immunity, making this year's declines even more worrisome.

Parents' hesitancy to go to hospitals and clinics amid the pandemic are understandable, but the CDC team underscored the duty of health care systems to establish safer alternatives to make it easier for kids to get vaccinated in such dangerous times.

They suggested that designated vaccination clinics could be set up in parking lots, here parents would not have to risk exposing themselves or their children to coronavirus.",15,Low,Right

The virus is covered in 's-protein' spikes, which allow the pathogen to enter and infect the body's cells.

The new mask would have enzymes in its membrane, or layer, that would attach to the protein spikes of the coronavirus, separating and killing them.

If successful, the mask would be able to be used by millions of frontline healthcare workers that come into contact with the virus every day, and many of whom have an inadequate supply of personal protective equipment.

The team was just awarded a $150,000 grant and says it will need six months to create and test the finished product. Pictured: Nurse Karen Hayes administers care to a patient in the acute care COVID-19 unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, May 7

'We have the capability to create a membrane that would not only effectively filter out the novel coronavirus like the N-95 mask does, but deactivate the virus completely,' said Dr Dibakar Bhattacharyya, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Kentucky, in a press release.

'This innovation would further slow and even prevent the virus from spreading. It would also have future applications to protect against a number of human pathogenic viruses.'

One of the new mask's most important features is that it captures the virus on the surface, which would lessen the number of particles in the air that could spread to other people.

Bhattacharyya told LEX 18 that the masks, which would be nontoxic and thin, might even change color when they detect coronavirus on their material.

The team just earned a $150,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, which is calling for proposals that help stop the spread of COVID-19.

Bhattacharyya says the team will need six months to create and test the finished product.

To test the mask, the scientists at the College of Engineers will also be working with those from the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Agriculture, Food and Environment.

Bhattacharyya says the cooperation across several departments is evidence of the university's 'collaborative spirit'.

'At the University of Kentucky, we have great resources at our fingertips and many opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research across disciplines,' he said.

'Our researchers work together and lend their expertise to solve challenges for the greater good of humanity, not only at a time like this, but every day.'

The team says it has no timeline for when the mask might be made available to the general public.

The University of Kentucky isn't the only institute of higher educations that is working on face masks development.

A team at Stanford University is trying to redesign N-95 masks, which reduce oxygen intake by five to 20 percent, so that oxygen deficiency is minimal.

Additionally, the Queensland University of Technology in Australia has developed a mask filter than can remove virus particles smaller than 100 nanometers, which is about the size of the virus.

In the US, there are more than 1.5 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 90,000 deaths.",15,Low,Right

The antibody, called S309, targets the 'spike proteins' found on the outside of the virus that are used to invade our cells.

Lab tests showed S309 sticks to the proteins, effectively neutralizing them, according to researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.

It comes as scientists at a California biotech company claim to have found an antibody that completely blocks the virus.

With only a few treatments - and only authorized for emergency use - for the potentially fatal disease, the two new developments offer hope of a therapy or even a vaccine.

Scientists discovered an antibody that inhibits the family of coronaviruses, including the novel virus (pictured) and SARS, in the blood sample of a SARS survivor

The antibody, called S309, disables the 'spike proteins' that the coronavirus uses to infect human cells. Pictured: Tel Aviv University researchers study the novel coronavirus

The antibody is now on a fast-track development and testing path at San Francisco-based Vir Biotechnology.

If successful, it paves the way for using S309 - alone or in a cocktail - as a vaccine for high-risk groups or a drug to combat severe life-threatening symptoms.

'We still need to show that this antibody is protective in living systems, which has not yet been done,' said Dr David Veesler, an assistant professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in a press release.

'Right now there are no approved tools or licensed therapeutics proven to fight against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19,' he added.

What make this new antibody different is it was discovered in someone infected with a different coronavirus, SARS, in 2003 - 17 years ago.

'This is what allowed us to move so fast compared to other groups,' Veesler said.

For the study, published in the journal Nature, the team identified several antibodies of interest from a blood sample of the SARS survivor in 'memory B cells' that form following an infectious illness.

They usually remember a pathogen the body has gotten rid of in the past, sometimes for a lifetime.

This triggers the launch of an antibody defense against a re-infection.

Experiments found that S309 was particularly effective at targeting and disabling the spike proteins.

It was able to destroy the virus, known as SARS CoV-2, by engaging with a section of the spike protein near the attachment site to the host cell.

Tests showed the antibody recognizes a binding site that is seen across many coronaviruses - not just SARS and COVID-19.

Combining S309 with other, weaker antibodies found in the SARS patient boosted the destruction of coronavirus.

This multiple cocktail may prevent the virus from mutating into a strain that the single-ingredient is defenseless at stopping.

It comes on the heels of Sorrento Therapeutics, based in San Diego, claiming its antibody, called STI-1499, stopped the virus from entering 100 percent of healthy human cells in petri dish experiments.

In a press release, the company says it has the ability to produce up to 200,000 doses of the antibody per month.

A spokesman for Boris Johnson said data currently shows 5,889 care homes have reported a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 outbreak during the pandemic.

This amounted to 38 per cent of all the homes in England, he said, and 343 of them had reported cases in the past seven days.

The government is facing scathing criticism over claims it left care homes in the lurch as it scrambled to protect the NHS at the start of the outbreak.

Office for National Statistics data shows that more than 12,500 care home residents died with coronavirus in March and April.

It is unclear how many people have been infected in homes because they have not been offered routine testing, meaning many have either recovered or died without a test to confirm that they had the virus.

Care home deaths of all causes have rocketed during the coronavirus crisis, suggesting even people who aren't killed directly by the illness are suffering

The ONS shows that care home residents have made up an increasing proportion of people dying because of the virus as the outbreak has gone on.

Overall, around 37 per cent of all the 33,841 COVID-19 deaths recorded in March and April happened in nursing homes.

In the week ending May 1, care home deaths accounted for 40 per cent of the total, while hospital deaths made up 53 per cent.

Two weeks earlier, however (April 11 to 17) this split was 23 per cent and 70 per cent.

And in the week ending April 3, just five per cent of deaths happened in care homes, compared to 89 per cent in hospitals.

A care home owner writing in the Sunday Times yesterday said that the NHS had shepherded patients out of hospitals and into care homes without being tested.

MAJORITY OF COVID-19 CARE HOME VICTIMS DIDN'T MAKE IT TO HOSPITAL The majority of care home residents with COVID-19 die in their care home, with just over one in four dying in hospital, analysis shows. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that just over one in four of all deaths of care home residents in England and Wales between March 2 and May 1 involved COVID-19. From 12,526 coronavirus deaths that happened during that period, 9,039 (72 per cent) occurred within a care home. A further 3,444 (27 per cent) occurred at hospital. The ONS also found that COVID-19 was the leading cause of death for male care home residents in England and Wales during the period, accounting for 30.3 per cent of deaths. It was the second leading cause of death in female care home residents, after dementia and Alzheimer's disease, accounting for 23.5 per cent of deaths. Of all hospital deaths involving COVID-19 during this period, 14.6 per cent were accounted for by care home residents. Source: Press Association Advertisement

Writing anonymously, he said: 'The government was asleep at the wheel. We were sent a public health document on March 13, which said that if any of our residents got significantly ill, they wouldn't allowed into hospital and would ave to die in their home. We'd never read anything like it.

'Elderly people weren't a priority. The government's thinking was: care homes won't be affected.

'But if anything, the war on COVID is happening in care homes, not just the NHS. The government is boasting how it did so well in protecting the NHS, but the reality is deaths in care homes.'

There are around 400,000 people living in care homes around the UK, many of whom have dementia or other debilitating health conditions.

As well as people dying as a direct result of the coronavirus, there are also thousands of 'excess deaths' happening in care homes - those that happen in addition to the average amount that would be expected.

People may be getting less medical care than they usually would, putting their health and lives at risk, experts say.

The Alzheimer's Society last week said there is a 'tragically high' number of people dying in care homes.

Director of research at the charity, Fiona Carragher, said: 'Sadly, devastation continues in care homes with more than three times the usual number of deaths than average reported clearly showing the cost of not putting social care on an equal footing with the NHS.

'We need to know why the death toll in care homes remains so high in addition to coronavirus-reported deaths. 70 per cent of care home residents have dementia and we’re deeply concerned that this indicates an increase in deaths due to dementia, caused by isolation and reduction in care workers.

'Each of these deaths is a heart-breaking loss to their friends, families and carers which is why the Government must honour their commitment to ensure care homes get testing for all residents and staff and the protective equipment they need.

'We now approach our third month of lockdown, still with a tragically high number of care home deaths.'

Real care home death toll in England and Wales could be as high as 22,000 - more than DOUBLE the official figure, academics claim

More than 22,000 care home residents across England and Wales may have already died as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a grim analysis.

Official data last week showed almost 9,000 COVID-19-related deaths in care homes had been recorded in the two countries by the start of May.

But researchers at the London School of Economics fear that count is a huge under-estimate, and the true toll could be more than twice as high.

They said that care home residents taken into hospital before they died were not being counted properly, and that others who didn't actually catch the virus may have died as a result of less available medical care or help with eating and drinking.

Their calculations took into account those home residents in hospitals, thought to make up 15 per cent of Britain's official death toll.

And the bleak projection also included 'excess deaths' - the number of people dying compared to average - across the care industry as a whole.

It comes as the Government is still under fire for not offering enough support to care homes during the crisis as the industry has accused it of rationing testing and protective equipment to focus its efforts on helping NHS hospitals.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer last week called on Boris Johnson, in Prime Minister's Questions, to account for 10,000 'unexplained' deaths in care homes in April which hadn't been factored into Government figures.

Mr Johnson admitted there was 'much more to do' to tackle the care home 'tragedy' but did not link the thousands of excess deaths to the coronavirus response.

The LSE research claims that the number of care home deaths officially recorded is actually only 41.6 per cent of the total.

Dr Jose-Luis Fernández and PhD researcher Adelina Comas-Herrera said: 'Data on deaths in care homes directly attributed to COVID-19 underestimate the impact of the pandemic on care home residents.

'They do not take account of indirect mortality effects of the pandemic or problems with the identification of the disease as the cause of death.

'Not all care home residents die in care homes, (according to CQC data, 15 per cent of all deaths of care home residents are found to happen in hospitals).

'Deaths of care home residents in hospitals are not currently accounted for in publicly available estimates of the number of deaths in care homes linked to the pandemic.'

The report showed that people dying and actually having COVID-19 mentioned on their death certificate may only make up a relatively small proportion of all care home residents who have died during the pandemic

The report said that people in care homes might have died because they had been forced to isolate in their rooms and missed out on help with eating and drinking.

They may also have not had the same access to medical care that would have been given before the pandemic, either because treatment was delayed or because they didn't want to go to hospital out of fear of catching the virus.

There are approximately 400,000 people living in nursing homes in Britain, and a majority of them have dementia, making them extremely vulnerable.

Dr Fernández and Ms Comas-Herrera's report added: 'Calculating total excess mortality in care homes since 28 December and adjusting this by the assumption that 15 per cent of care home residents die in hospital, suggests that by the 1st May there had been in excess of 22,000 deaths of care home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales.'

The LSE report comes after weekly statistics showed almost 10,000 care home residents have now died of coronavirus in Britain - a quarter of all the UK's victims.

By the start of this month 8,312 people had died in care homes in England and Wales, along with 1,195 in Scotland and 232 in Northern Ireland - a total of 9,739.

A spokesperson for the ONS, which collects the most accurate data on deaths in all parts of the community, said: 'Our data shows just under 20,000 ""excess"" deaths registered up to 1 May above average in care home settings since the pandemic started.

'Of those, 8,312 have had COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate. We are undertaking further analysis on all deaths of care home residents which will be published on Friday.'

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Prime Minister Boris Johnson clashed in Parliament as Mr Starmer urged the PM to account for 10,000 'unexplained' excess deaths that had happened in care homes in England and Wales in April

Although the number of people dying in care homes has remained lower than hospital deaths so far, residents are making up a larger proportion of the fatalities being reported each week, from just five per cent of the total at the start of April to 40 per cent at the end of the month

Bosses and staff in the care industry have accused officials of overlooking them in a scramble to 'protect the NHS'.

Routine tests were not available for staff or residents for most of March and April and staff say vital personal protective equipment (PPE) has been in limited supply.

Last week top scientists said that ongoing, uncontrolled outbreaks in homes was contributing to Britain's slow emergence from lockdown.

The reproduction rate of the virus is believed to be higher inside the homes and in hospitals, meaning it is spreading faster and is still a danger, even though it is now at low levels in the community.

In Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged Boris Johnson to explain why there had been 10,000 'unexplained' care home deaths in April.

Mr Starmer said: 'The ONS records the average number of deaths in care homes each month. The last five years the average for April has been just over 8,000.

'This year the number of deaths in care homes for April was a staggering 26,000 - that's three times the average - 18,000 additional deaths this April.

'Using the Government's figures only 8,000 are recorded as COVID deaths, that leaves 10,000 additional and unexplained care home deaths this April.'

The Prime Minister did not link the 10,000 deaths to the coronavirus response but admitted there was 'much more to do' to address the 'tragedy' hitting the industry.

Mr Johnson said: 'Coronavirus is an appalling disease which afflicts some groups far more than others, I think the whole country understands.

'And in particular the elderly, and he's right to draw attention, as I said, to the tragedy that has been taking place in care homes.

'The Office of National Statistics is responsible for producing the data that they have, the Government had also produced data which not only shows that there has been, as I said, a terrible epidemic in care homes but since the care homes action plan began we are seeing an appreciable and substantial reduction, not just in the number of outbreaks but also in the number of deaths.'

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a tweet: 'We're injecting a further £600 million for care homes with our infection control fund to protect residents and staff in our coronavirus battle'.

ONS data shows that, although homes are still reported to be in the grip of the virus, the number of people dying in them had started to fall by the end of April.

At least 8,314 people had died of COVID-19 in England's care homes by May 8, data from the Care Quality Commission shows. When deaths from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are added the figure is 9,739

Data for England and Wales shows the number of people dying of COVID-19 - and therefore the total number of people dying week-on-week - had clearly started falling by the end of April

DEMENTIA PATIENTS 'ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER SEVERE CORONAVIRUS' Dementia sufferers are up to three times more likely to develop severe coronavirus, according to a study. Researchers analysed data from 450 patients over the age of 65 who tested positive for COVID-19. University of Exeter and the University of Connecticut experts then compared them with 250,000 older people without the infection. An analysis showed around 0.5 per cent of pensioners needed hospital treatment for coronavirus overall, compared to 3.5 per cent of dementia patients. The rate dropped to just three-fold higher for dementia patients when other factors were taken into account, The Telegraph reports. It could explain why care homes are baring a large brunt of the UK's COVID-19 crisis, with the majority of the 400,000 residents having dementia.

Between April 18 and 24, care homes in England and Wales recorded 2,794 residents' deaths. But between April 25 and May 1 this fell to 2,423.

Although a single week's drop is not enough to be certain of a trend, it coincided with a marked drop in deaths of all causes (21,997 to 17,953), in COVID-19 deaths in any location (6,746 to 4,744) and coronavirus hospital deaths (4,841 to 3,214).

The scale of the tragedy in care homes has become clearer as the outbreak has progressed and appears to have peaked later than the crisis in hospitals.

In the week ending May 1, care home deaths accounted for 40 per cent of the total, while hospital deaths made up 53 per cent.

Two weeks earlier, however (April 11 to 17) this split was 23 per cent and 70 per cent.

And in the week ending April 3, just five per cent of deaths happened in care homes, compared to 89 per cent in hospitals.

The Alzheimer's Society said there is a 'tragically high' number of people dying in care homes.

Director of research at the charity, Fiona Carragher, said yesterday: 'Sadly, devastation continues in care homes with more than three times the usual number of deaths than average reported clearly showing the cost of not putting social care on an equal footing with the NHS.

'We need to know why the death toll in care homes remains so high in addition to coronavirus-reported deaths. 70 per cent of care home residents have dementia and we’re deeply concerned that this indicates an increase in deaths due to dementia, caused by isolation and reduction in care workers.

'Each of these deaths is a heart-breaking loss to their friends, families and carers which is why the Government must honour their commitment to ensure care homes get testing for all residents and staff and the protective equipment they need.

'We now approach our third month of lockdown, still with a tragically high number of care home deaths.'

The charity added that dementia patients are 'really struggling' with visiting restrictions and urged the Government to find a way to facilitate visiting hours to prevent their social wellbeing being 'irreversibly damaged'.",15,Low,Right

England suffered more coronavirus deaths than Italy during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, according to a shock new analysis.

London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine researchers looked at total excess mortality, which shows how many more people than average have died in a period.

Figures showed Italy's outbreak peak occurred on March 27, with almost 15,000 fatalities that week - 103 per cent higher than the average for the same week in previous years.

Data also revealed England hit the peak two weeks later, which chimed with claims throughout the early outbreak that Britain was a fortnight behind Italy. It showed there were almost 20,000 deaths in the week ending April 10, a 109 per cent jump on the same week in years before.

It comes as officials have been accused of a cover-up by ditching the global death comparison charts in the daily Downing Street briefings. Critics noticed the slide was withheld from the press conferences after it clearly showed the UK had become Europe's hardest-hit nation.

The Government has said now is not the time for international comparisons, and tried to paint them as unreliable as the death toll continues to rise in Britain.

Graphs show how the number of excess deaths compared across the US, with New York City having the biggest spike in extra fatalities

Official figures show 34,636 Brits who have tested positive for COVID-19 have now died since the first death was confirmed at the start of March.

But the true death toll is likely to be much higher because it only takes into account laboratory-confirmed cases, missing thousands of suspected patients.

And the official toll - given by the Department of Health every day - is also affected by a recording lag. Hospitals can take weeks to announce a death.

Using this way of looking at deaths, the UK has the world's second-highest death toll - behind only the US (90,000).

The UK's Office for National Statistics is collecting more accurate data and suggests that, so far, the true death toll is considerably higher, probably in excess of 45,000.

The ONS figure is much higher because it has always included people who die anywhere in the community, as well as those who were never officially tested but had COVID-19 mentioned on their death certificate.

Department of Health data does not include anyone who has not tested positive.

Many scientists say the most accurate way of looking at the true scale of the COVID-19 crisis is to take an in-depth look at 'excess deaths'.

Figures also show how the region of Lombardy was the hardest hit area of Italy, with an almost 300 per cent jump in excess deaths towards the end of March

WHAT ARE EXCESS DEATHS AND WHY ARE THEY THE BEST WAY TO COMPARE DEATHS? Excess deaths are those which occur in addition to any that would be expected to happen in the same period in an average year. They are measured in the UK over a five-year average. For example, if the average number of deaths in the first week of April over the least five years was 10,000, the 10,001st person to die in that week is considered an excess death, along with any others who come after them. Ministers have admitted 'excess deaths' are the most reliable measure of how many fatalities the coronavirus has actually contributed to. They take into account not just infected people who have died of COVID-19 but also those who died because of indirect effects of the outbreak. The biggest contribution to this is expected to be people whose medical treatment was interrupted or stopped because of the pandemic, including people who avoided going to hospital. NHS data shows A&E attendances have halved since March. Advertisement

ONS figures released last week - the most recent available - showed at least 50,000 more people than usual have died in Britain since the pandemic began.

Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said analysing all-cause mortality was the best way to look at scale of the crisis.

He told independent organisation FullFact: 'I feel the only unbiased comparison you could make between different countries is by looking at all-cause mortality.

'There are so many questions about the rise we have seen in deaths that have not got COVID-19 on the death certificate.'

He added that many of these will be 'inevitably linked in some way to this epidemic', saying that those figures he would 'prefer to look at'.

Professor Michael Coleman, an epidemiologist at LSHTM, told The Guardian: 'Even if all the persons whose death certificate mentioned Covid-19 are counted, a quarter of the excess mortality in England and Wales is not explained.

'This occurs because some deaths caused by coronavirus occur among people who were not tested.

'Other deaths occur among people with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory conditions that were made worse by coronavirus, and some deaths from unrelated conditions may occur because the health system was overwhelmed.

'All these deaths form part of the overall public health impact of the epidemic, but they will not be revealed by restricting reports to deaths among people who were tested for Covid-19.

'So, in a fast-moving pandemic, the cause of death on the death certificate is not a good way to assess the overall public health impact of the disease.'

Scientists say that accurately comparing countries is difficult and unreliable because each government records death and disease differently, making like-for-like comparisons impossible.

But looking at even raw numbers shows the UK is doing worse than its neighbours, experts say, and can give a broad view of what is happening globally.

Another EU monitoring project has shown England has had the worst excess death rate in Europe during the coronavirus pandemic.

EuroMOMO assigns each country a 'Z-score', showing the deviation from a five-year average of excess deaths.

Many countries, including Spain, Germany, France and Italy, have recorded a spike in excess deaths during the pandemic.

But figures collected by EuroMOMO show England performing worse than Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or any other European country.

England's Z-score peaked at 44.1 during the week that ended April 19, according to the monitoring project, with Spain in second place at 34.7.

The other three UK nations had a far lower Z-score, with Wales peaking at 19.3, Scotland at 17.3 and Northern Ireland at 8.5.

The UK announced a further 170 deaths from coronavirus today on the first Sunday since draconian lockdown measures were eased

The global death comparison graph has been a fixture of Number 10 coronavirus press conferences but the data is no longer being published by the Government. This chart was taken from a Downing Street briefing last week

It comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer last week accused Boris Johnson of a cover-up after officials scrapped the international death toll comparison graph.

The graph - comparing the UK to Italy, the US and other nations - was a fixture of the daily Number 10 press conference throughout the outbreak.

Sir Keir claimed at Prime Minister's Questions the data is being withheld because it shows the UK is the worst affected nation in Europe.

The Prime Minister hit back and said it was 'premature' to make such comparisons as he labelled coronavirus a 'once in a century epidemic'.

But Mr Johnson's defence was called 'baffling' by Sir Keir, as he pointed out that the Government has repeatedly published the graph during the crisis.

Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, then piled the pressure on Number 10 to change tack.

She told the daily Downing Street press conference last week there was 'no reason' why the data could not be published.",15,Low,Right

Britain's coronavirus death toll continued its downward trend today after officials announced 160 more victims, taking the official number of fatalities closer to the 35,000-mark.

The daily figure - confirmed this afternoon by the Department of Health - is the lowest since March 24 (149), the first official day of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's lockdown.

For comparison, the final figure announced yesterday was 170. Statistics also show just 210 COVID-19 deaths were recorded last Monday, as well as 288 on the same day the week before.

Death numbers released on Sundays and Mondays are usually smaller due to a delay in processing fatalities over the weekend.

Health officials also announced 2,684 more cases of the coronavirus, taking the official size of the outbreak past 246,000. But the true scale of the UK's crisis is estimated to be in the millions.

Other promising data today revealed fewer than 700 patients were admitted to hospital on Saturday, and every region of England is seeing a drop in the number of COVID-19 patients in hospital.

In this afternoon's daily briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed that the government has now hired 21,000 contact tracers for the UK's 'test, track and trace' plan for easing lockdown.

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, said he was preparing for the country to have to live with the coronavirus for months, if not years, in the future, and only time would tell if a vaccine will help or if the virus would be less able to spread in warmer weather.

In other developments to Britain's coronavirus crisis today:

Ministers are mulling coronavirus 'air bridges' to allow travellers to move between countries without the need for quarantine once the outbreak is under control;

Anyone over the age of five in the UK with coronavirus symptoms can now apply for a test, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced;

Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary launched a savage attack on the government's plans for 14-day quarantine on arrivals to the UK;

Thousands more people have gone back to work as the transport network capacity is ramped up to help social distancing;

People should self-isolate if they lose their sense of taste or smell because it is now an official symptom of coronavirus, the government announced;

Unions were asked to work with ministers to reopen schools amid fears poor children are doing less home learning every day than their better-off counterparts.

Department of Health chiefs have yet to reveal the final toll, which is likely to be higher. The preliminary tally is calculated by adding up the individual counts of each of the home nations

Dominic Raab held the Downing Street briefing tonight

Department of Health's final official death toll announced yesterday was 34,636. This included 28,000 fatalities in hospitals - the rest occurred in other settings, such as care homes.

Officials counted only 170 new deaths, which was the lowest daily count since March 24 (149). The count does not reflect how many people succumbed to the illness in the past 24 hours.

Instead, it relates only to how many deaths were registered over the last day. This process can take several weeks because of a recording lag.

NHS England - whose tally is not always the same as the figure the DH reports for hospitals because of a difference in how fatalities are recorded - today announced 122 more deaths.

Figures showed Italy's peak occurred on March 27, with almost 15,000 fatalities that week. Analysis showed the total number of deaths was 103 per cent higher than the average for the same week in previous years. Data also revealed England hit the peak two weeks later, which chimed with claims throughout the early outbreak that Britain was a fortnight behind Italy.

BRITS SHOULD SELF-ISOLATE IF THEY LOSE THEIR SENSE OF SMELL OR TASTE, OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE People should now self-isolate if they lose their sense of smell or taste because it is a definite symptom of coronavirus, the government announced today. In the first change to the policy since the beginning of the outbreak, officials have added a third tell-tale sign to the NHS's definition of COVID-19. The chief medical officers of the UK say anosmia - the scientific name for the loss of the senses - is clearly linked to the virus and should be treated with the same amount of caution as a fever or a new cough, the only other two official symptoms. Angered doctors welcomed the move but said it had 'taken too long', with the UK lagging behind other countries and the World Health Organization after nose and throat specialists first sounded the alarm about this in March. One researcher who runs Imperial College London's COVID Symptom Tracker app said up to 70,000 current coronavirus patients are roaming free or still working because the government is not warning people about minor symptoms. Professor Tim Spector said his team have linked 14 symptoms to the virus but the NHS and Department of Health are only recognising three. Ministers were last week warned that as many as one in four patients are unaware they have COVID-19 because they don't get a cough or fever, but do suffer from anosmia or other less well known signs. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said officials hope adding the symptom to the list will help medics to detect three per cent more patients. 'With a cough or fever, sensitivity was around 91 per cent,' he said in a telephone briefing this morning. 'By adding anosmia, in terms of case pick-up, we think that might go to 94 per cent.' Advertisement

In comparison, yesterday the organisation announced just 90 COVID-19 fatalities. Officials said this was because the Covid Patient Notification System 'did not operate for a period of time on Saturday'.

As a result, NHS England admitted today's toll - which included seven patients who had no underlying conditions - would be slightly higher to reflect that.

Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland announced only two more deaths, while Wales had four and Northern Ireland six across all settings. But the individual tallies do not always match up with the final DH count.

The figures come after the government today announced that Britons who lose their sense of smell or taste should self-isolate because it has now been added to the list of official symptoms.

In the first change to the policy since the beginning of the outbreak, officials confirmed anosmia as the third tell-tale sign of COVID-19.

Angered doctors welcomed the move but said it had 'taken too long', with the UK lagging behind other countries and the World Health Organization after nose and throat specialists first sounded the alarm about this in March.

Experts today also warned a working coronavirus vaccine is unlikely to be ready this year, as they told people not to have 'false expectations' that Britons could get a jab by September.

Both Oxford University and Imperial College London are working on vaccines with the former now having done a deal with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to mass produce its effort if it is shown to be effective.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma revealed yesterday the government is hoping to be in a position to roll-out a mass vaccination programme in the Autumn of this year.

But Professor Robin Shattock, one of the experts involved in the Imperial initiative, urged caution as he said there are 'no guarantees' a working vaccine will be ready for mass production until next year at the earliest.

MINISTERS ARE MULLING 'AIR BRIDGES' TO ALLOW TRAVELLERS TO MOVE BETWEEN COUNTRIES WITHOUT THE NEED TO BE QUARANTINED Ministers are mulling coronavirus 'air bridges' to allow travellers to move between countries without the need for quarantine once the outbreak is under control, it was revealed today. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said a 'blanket' 14-day quarantine rule for arrivals will be introduced from next month. But he disclosed that there are 'active discussions' going on over what countries could be exempted from the regime in future, referring to the idea of 'air bridges' - usually used to refer to military flights over enemy territory. Countries with lower infection levels, such as Australia, New Zealand and Greece, could potentially be excluded from the tough rules, which will be enforced by law. Earlier, Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary launched a savage attack on the government's plans for 14-day quarantine on arrivals to the UK. The new rules are set dash hopes of summer holidays for most of the summer, as exemptions are largely limited to lorry drivers. However, Mr O'Leary dismissed claims it will prevent his aim of resuming flights in July, saying he believes the policy is so 'defective' and impossible to enforce that the public will merely ignore it. He insisted the government is 'making stuff up as they go along' and face masks are the best way to protect the travelling public - despite many scientists saying they are of limited benefit.

In other developments today, Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland could start taking 'concrete steps' to ease lockdown at the end of the month - which would be nearly three weeks after Boris Johnson triggered his exit plan.

The First Minister said she had stuck with the draconian restrictions 'a bit longer' to ensure that the outbreak was 'suppressed'.

But she said she expected the 'journey to normality' will be able to begin at the end of May, despite warning that the disease has 'not gone away''.

The measures - being unveiled as part of a 'route map' on Thursday - could be broadly similar to the blueprint published by the PM last week.

That has seen people encouraged to go back to work where possible, as well as slightly looser rules on sports and limited contact between households.

He added that many of these will be 'inevitably linked in some way to this epidemic', saying that those figures he would 'prefer to look at'.

Professor Michael Coleman, an epidemiologist at LSHTM, told The Guardian: 'Even if all the persons whose death certificate mentioned Covid-19 are counted, a quarter of the excess mortality in England and Wales is not explained.

'This occurs because some deaths caused by coronavirus occur among people who were not tested.

'Other deaths occur among people with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory conditions that were made worse by coronavirus, and some deaths from unrelated conditions may occur because the health system was overwhelmed.

'All these deaths form part of the overall public health impact of the epidemic, but they will not be revealed by restricting reports to deaths among people who were tested for Covid-19.

'So, in a fast-moving pandemic, the cause of death on the death certificate is not a good way to assess the overall public health impact of the disease.'

Scientists say that accurately comparing countries is difficult and unreliable because each government records death and disease differently, making like-for-like comparisons impossible.

But looking at even raw numbers shows the UK is doing worse than its neighbours, experts say, and can give a broad view of what is happening globally.

Another EU monitoring project has shown England has had the worst excess death rate in Europe during the coronavirus pandemic.

EuroMOMO assigns each country a 'Z-score', showing the deviation from a five-year average of excess deaths.

Many countries, including Spain, Germany, France and Italy, have recorded a spike in excess deaths during the pandemic.

But figures collected by EuroMOMO show England performing worse than Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or any other European country.

England's Z-score peaked at 44.1 during the week that ended April 19, according to the monitoring project, with Spain in second place at 34.7.

The other three UK nations had a far lower Z-score, with Wales peaking at 19.3, Scotland at 17.3 and Northern Ireland at 8.5.

The global death comparison graph has been a fixture of Number 10 coronavirus press conferences but the data is no longer being published by the Government. This chart was taken from a Downing Street briefing last week

It comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer last week accused Boris Johnson of a cover-up after officials scrapped the international death toll comparison graph.

The graph - comparing the UK to Italy, the US and other nations - was a fixture of the daily Number 10 press conference throughout the outbreak.

Sir Keir claimed at Prime Minister's Questions the data is being withheld because it shows the UK is the worst affected nation in Europe.

The Prime Minister hit back and said it was 'premature' to make such comparisons as he labelled coronavirus a 'once in a century epidemic'.

But Mr Johnson's defence was called 'baffling' by Sir Keir, as he pointed out that the Government has repeatedly published the graph during the crisis.

Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, then piled the pressure on Number 10 to change tack.

She told the daily Downing Street press conference last week there was 'no reason' why the data could not be published.",15,Low,Right

In the first change to the policy since the beginning of the outbreak, officials have added a third tell-tale sign to the government's definition of COVID-19.

The chief medical officers of the UK say anosmia - the scientific name for the loss of the senses - is clearly linked to the virus and should be treated with the same amount of caution as a fever or a new cough, the only other two official symptoms.

Angered doctors welcomed the move but said it had 'taken too long', with the UK lagging behind other countries and the World Health Organization after nose and throat specialists first sounded the alarm about this in March.

US health authorities listed the symptom on the weekend of April 18, for example, and the boss of the French health service warned citizens about it as early as March.

One researcher who runs King's College London's COVID Symptom Tracker app said up to 70,000 current coronavirus patients are roaming free or still working because the government is not warning people about minor symptoms.

Professor Tim Spector said his team have linked 14 symptoms to the virus but the Department of Health is only recognising three.

Ministers were last week warned that as many as one in four patients are unaware they have COVID-19 because they don't get a cough or fever, but do suffer from anosmia or other less well known signs.

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said officials hope adding the symptom to the list will help medics to detect three per cent more patients.

'With a cough or fever, sensitivity was around 91 per cent,' he said in a telephone briefing this morning. 'By adding anosmia, in terms of case pick-up, we think that might go to 94 per cent.'

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said this morning that officials hoped adding anosmia to the list of official symptoms would help them to pick up two per cent more COVID-19 cases

Until today, a fever or a new continuous cough had been the only officially recognised symptoms of the coronavirus. Now, anosmia - a lost or changed sense of smell or taste - will be added to the list

Professor Van-Tam added: 'The reason for making the change now is that there has been a signal around the importance of anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19 for a while now.

'It has been important to continue to look at that and be sure that we consider it and introduce it at the right time... this has been quite a difficult piece of science.'

ENT UK, which represents specialist ear, nose and throat doctors, last week accused government officials of 'clinical negligence' in taking so long to include anosmia on its official list of symptoms which require someone to self-isolate.

Professor Nirmal Kumar, the president of the association and a practising doctor in London, told MailOnline that anosmia was a worrying symptom because it didn't stop people carrying on with their lives and spreading the virus.

WHAT SYMPTOMS IS THE GOVERNMENT MISSING? Researchers at King’s College London and healthcare science company, ZOE Global, are running an app called COVID Symptom Tracker, which is being used regularly by more than three million people. It works by people logging on every day to report, anonymously, how they are feeling and whether they have tested positive for coronavirus. They have come up with a list of at least 14 symptoms which, if someone reports having them, increases their likelihood of testing positive for coronavirus. This suggests they are symptoms of the disease. The top three, in bold, are the only ones officially recognised by the NHS and government. If someone phoned 111 and described their illness but did not have one of those three, they would be told they do not need to self-isolate. The 14 symptoms are: Fever

Persistent cough

Anosmia (lost smell/taste)

Fatigue

Shortness of breath

Diarrhoea

Delirium

Skipped meals

Abdominal pain

Chest pain

Hoarse voice

Skin rash

Hives

Severe muscle pain Advertisement

Fatigue, for example, would leave someone bed-ridden, while a cough might make someone think twice about going out in public, Professor Kumar said.

'We're relieved that this has finally been accepted but we alerted people about this eight weeks ago,' he said.

'Everyone else, including the World Health Organization, took it up urgently, but it has certainly taken too long here.

'The prevalence is widespread. We used to see these patients occasionally but now we see them regularly.

'If we had recognised this earlier we would have reduced the spread. The reproduction rate of the virus would have been lower.'

Professor Tim Spector said that thousands of coronavirus patients are going under the government's radar because its symptom definitions are too narrow.

He said on BBC Radio 4 today: 'We list about 14 symptoms which we know are related to having a positive swab test, and these are not being picked up by the NHS.

'At the moment, people are being told to go back to work if they're a care worker, and they've got something like loss of smell or taste or severe muscle pains or fatigue - things that we know and we've shown are related to being swabbed positive.

'This country is missing the ball in underestimated cases but also putting people at risk, and continuing the epidemic.'

He pointed the blame at Public Health England, which experts say was told weeks ago about other symptoms of the disease.

A paper outlining the symptoms Professor Spector's COVID Symptom Tracker app has picked up on includes fever, persistent cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, delirium, skipped meals, abdominal pain, chest pain, hoarse voice, anosmia, skin rash, severe muscle pain and hives.

'There's no point telling people to be alert if they don't know the symptoms,' Professor Spector added.

The government has come under fire for not listing a lost sense of smell and taste as a symptom of coronavirus sooner. Pictured, the NHS website as it still appears

'At the moment they're not really being offered tests, and they're being told not to self isolate if they don't have the fever and the cough and it's probably around half of the people in the population who are in that situation.

US AND FRANCE LISTED SYMPTOM WEEKS AGO The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US listed 'New loss of taste or smell' under its list of coronavirus symptoms on the weekend of April 18 and 19. Its addition followed reports from doctors in the US as well as in China and South Korea, where the early coronavirus outbreaks took place. It appears alongside chills, muscle pain and sore throat, which also are not listed in the UK. In France, anosmia is included as the third question in an official 22-question run-through which directs people to the right medical care. The head of the French health service, Jérôme Salomon, warned his countrymen about the sign as early as March, The Connexion reported. He said that if people suddenly lose their sense of smell or taste they should stay home and phone their doctor.

'We are probably missing at the moment between 50,000 and 70,000 people out there who are infected. We know that their swab tests will be positive.

'Someone has got to urgently ask this question of why we're the only country in this crisis that isn't really widening our group of symptoms and get on with it and do something.'

It is not yet clear how many people who catch COVID-19 do lose their sense of smell, and Professor Van-Tam said estimates range from the 'teens' to more than 50 per cent.

But data collected by Public Health England about the first few hundreds patients in the UK has convinced officials that there is a strong enough link connecting the two.

The deputy CMO said today: 'We're absolutely sure that other symptoms exist, including symptoms you wouldn't usually associate with a respiratory virus, such as abdominal pain.

'Some are so non-specific they would cause more confusion than clarity. Fatigue, for example, is a genuine symptom of COVID but any number of people suffer fatigue for a variety of reasons.'

Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted he had lost his sense of smell when he fell ill with the virus, but that it had returned soon after he recovered.

NOSE AND THROAT DOCTORS SOUNDED THE ALARM IN MARCH Specialist doctors called for the British Government to recognise anosmia - the loss or change of sense of smell and taste - as a symptom of COVID-19 two months ago. ENT UK, which represents ear, nose and throat doctors, said medics worldwide were seeing 'significantly' higher numbers of patients with the symptom. On March 25 ENT UK said in a statement: 'We believe this is related to COVID-19 infection. 'At present, many affected patients do not have other symptoms, or only mild disease, and therefore do not meet the criteria for testing. 'While loss of smell may be caused by other viruses, we think that it is reasonable to assume that COVID-19 is the cause until tests prove negative. 'We therefore advise that patients follow current guidelines for self-isolating if they develop new onset anosmia. This will also apply to cohabiting friends or family.' The government did not take up the call and did not add anosmia until the list today. On May 13, last Wednesday, the same organisation said in a scathing press release: 'We have been in regular contact with PHE regarding the utility of anosmia as a marker of infection. 'However, anosmia is not yet included in the list of associated symptoms used by the NHS 111 service. Key workers, often dealing with vulnerable groups, are told they must still go to work as they do not meet the criteria for diagnosis. 'At the time of writing, NHS 111 declares ""it is unlikely you have COVID-19"" unless you have a cough or fever; loss of sense of smell and taste, myalgia, fatigue and gastrointestinal upset are all disregarded. 'In the face of the current evidence base, this now amounts to clinical negligence.' ENT UK today welcomed the announcement but said 'it has certainly taken too long'.

Professor Van-Tam said officials in the UK had not rushed to include the symptom because it was not certain in many cases that people were losing their sense of smell or taste directly because of the coronavirus.

Other viruses which affect the airways are known to have the same effect, including common colds and the flu.

Adding the symptom to the list too soon may have caused confusion or led people without the virus to believe that they had it, the deputy CMO added.

In most cases people's senses do return to normal after their illness but it is possible that it can be permanent.

The UK's four chief medical officers, led by Professor Chris Whitty, said in a statement today: 'We have been closely monitoring the emerging data and evidence on COVID-19 and after thorough consideration, we are now confident enough to recommend this new measure.

'The individual’s household should also self-isolate for 14 days as per the current guidelines and the individual should stay at home for seven days, or longer if they still have symptoms other than cough or loss of sense of smell or taste.'

Today's step comes after government ministers were warned last week that the virus was going undetected in as many as a quarter or people who have it, because they had atypical symptoms.

NERVTAG, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, warned officials last week that more people say they are losing smell or taste than have a cough and fever together.

They called for the public to be given a 'wider perception' of signs that could indicate COVID-19, the Sunday Telegraph reported.

Professor Peter Openshaw, an experimental medicine expert at Imperial College London, told the newspaper that as many as a quarter of patients could be missed.

He said: 'In the self-reported symptoms, the loss of sense of smell comes out as a very, very frequent one.

'But in terms of how often that would actually lead to a diagnosis of COVID, that's not quite clear...

'It is important people have a wider perception of how it may present.'

Scientists today welcomed the news that anosmia had been added to the list but echoed concerns that it had taken so long.

Professor Carl Philpott, a rhinology expert at the University of East Anglia, said: 'The announcement that the CMOs have now recognised smell and taste disturbances is extremely welcome, albeit much later than other European counterparts and at least two weeks after the WHO added it to their list.

'This will hopefully now be another measure by which the pandemic can be contained, especially as in some people it may be the only symptom or may precede other symptoms.

'This is particularly pertinent in healthcare workers where reports of smell and taste disturbances have been commonplace, meaning the transfer of infection from colleagues to each other and to uninfected patients will have been happening unchecked.

'There will also be a recognition that although many patients will recover these senses, the need for ongoing support will be faced by a minority in whom these sensory losses persist.'",15,Low,Right

Doctors at The Royal Glamorgan Hospital, South Wales have said nicotine patches must urgently be considered as a potential COVID-19 treatment and are waiting for the go-ahead for a trial.

Studies of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in China, the US, Italy, UK and elsewhere have shown a surprisingly low prevalence of smokers. It suggests smokers are less likely to catch the disease - a theory that scientists have admitted is 'weird'.

But once smokers are in hospital, they may be more likely to see their disease rapidly progress and lead to death, according to some evidence.

It's been suggested that withdrawal from the addictive chemical nicotine while in hospital may exacerbate lung damage among smokers, raising their risk of suffering severe complications.

Nicotine has been shown to prevent lung damage in animals with acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening condition the coronavirus can lead to. And studies have shown it may prevent a severe over-reaction of the immune system called a cytokine storm - a phenomenon found to be killing many COVID-19 patients.

Doctors in France have called for trials of nicotine patches to see if they could have any protective effects. But medics emphasise it is likely to be nicotine, not cigarettes themselves, that may be beneficial for smokers.

A theory flouted by scientists is that nicotine reduces ACE-2 receptors, which are proteins in the body the virus binds to in order to infect cells.

Studies of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in China, the US, Italy, UK and elsewhere have shown a surprisingly low prevalence of smokers. University of College London reviewed 28 studies and found smoking rates were lower than expected among COVID-19 patients: The graph shows the smoking rate of each country against the percentage of smokers among COVID-19 patients. The lowest figure has been chosen for each country to show the stark comparison discovered by some studies

A recent study in Italy showed that less than five per cent of 441 hospitalised COVID-19 patients in an Italian study were smokers - compared with 24 per cent in the population

Once smokers are in hospital, they may be more likely to see their disease rapidly progress and lead to death, according to some evidence. The Italian study found more smokers succumbed to the disease - almost half compared to 35 per cent of those who had never touched a cigarette

Doctors at The Royal Glamorgan Hospital published a letter in March suggesting nicotine patches could be therapeutic against COVID-19.

They wrote in the British Medical Journal: 'In this new disease smokers seem to have particularly poor outcomes.

'We suggest that the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed.'

Jonathan Davies, a consultant trauma surgeon at the hospital, told MailOnline: 'We are looking at a number of possible points at which nicotine might be a valid intervention from prevention to treatment.

'Of course none are proven at present and the idea of any trials would be to investigate further.

'Whether or not we can proceed will depend up approval and funding which we are looking at urgently at present.

'In a nutshell the question is, are people who smoke see to be less likely to catch it So does nicotine given to people who don’t smoker offer some sort of protection?

'I would like to get a cohort of people in the general population and give half a nicotine patch for six week and the other half a placebo path and then see if there is a difference in antibodies [which indicate coronavirus infection]. That would be my mainstream preference.'

FRANCE LIMITS SALES OF NICOTINE PATCHES France limited the sale of nicotine substitutes to avoid stockpiling after research suggested the addictive substance could have the potential to protect people from contracting the coronavirus. Pharmacies were only able to sell a maximum of one month's worth of products treating nicotine dependence, such as patches, chewing gum or lozenges, until May 11. The sale of such products online was suspended entirely. The move was to 'firstly prevent the health risks from excessive consumption or misuse linked to media coverage of the possible protective effect of nicotine against COVID-19,' the government said in a statement. 'Secondly it guarantees continuous and appropriate supply to people requiring medical support to stop smoking.' It came after French researchers said they were planning to trial whether nicotine patches will help prevent - or lessen the effects of - the deadly coronavirus. Doctors at a major hospital in Paris - who also found low rates of smoking among the infected - are now planning to give nicotine patches to COVID-19 patients. They will also give them to frontline workers to see if the stimulant has any effect on preventing the spread of the virus, according to reports. The French study, performed at Pitié Salpêtrière - part of the Hôpitaux de Paris, used data from 480 patients who tested positive for the virus. Three hundred and fifty were hospitalized and the remainder recovered at home. Results showed that of the patients hospitalized, with a median age of 65, only 4.4 percent were regular smokers. But among those at home, with a median age of 44, 5.3 percent smoked. By comparison, among the general population, 40 percent of those between ages 44 and 53 smoke, and around 11 percent of those aged 65 to 75 smoke. The researchers determined that far fewer smokers appear to have contracted the virus or, if they have, their symptoms are less serious. Advertisement

The suggestion led to conversations with Professor Judith Hall, an intensive care expert at Cardiff University, who has said she will approach British funding bodies for support to trial.

She told The Guardian the idea was 'an interesting one', though its value would be difficult to prove.

'Getting trials under way is of course time-consuming and complicated business, but we must try and advance new ideas as quickly as possible in this crisis,' she said.

Researchers in France were the first to announce a planned trial of nicotine patches at a major hospital in Paris - after a review of patients at the hospital also found low rates of smoking among the infected.

Dr Davies said nicotine patches are cheap, do not have side effects, and could offer an alternative while scientists race to find a vaccine - if proven effective.

Interest in the topic has peaked following swathes of studies that showed a low prevalence of smokers in hospitals with COVID-19.

A review of 28 studies by University College London in April found a 'lower than expected' rate of smokers among COVID-19 patients.

One of the studies showed that in the UK the proportion of smokers among COVID-19 patients was just five per cent, a third of the national rate of 14.4 per cent.

Another found in France the rate was four times lower. In China, a study noted 3.8 per cent of patients were smokers - despite more than half of the population regularly smoking cigarettes.

When smokers do get diagnosed with the virus, however, they appear to be more likely to get so sick that they need ventilation, two studies in the review showed.

More recently Italian researchers found fewer than five per cent of 441 COVID-19 patients who needed to be admitted to an Italian hospital were smokers.

The scientists described it as a 'very low' number, given that a quarter of the general population are known to be hooked on cigarettes.

Researchers have noted that low prevalence of smokers may just be because doctors are just too busy to be accurately noting down everyone's smoking habits, or patients are too unwell to speak.

Considering elderly people are more likely to be hospitalised with COVID-19, low smoking rates may be explained by differences in smoking rates in different age groups, with middle-aged people more likely to have the habit.

There is often data missing in these studies too, which could skew results.

If the findings are proven, scientists say it's likely that it is not cigarettes - filled with thousands of harmful chemicals - that would offer a potential protection, but the nicotine that is beneficial.

A theory flouted by scientists is that nicotine reduces ACE-2 receptors, which are proteins in the body the virus binds to in order to infect cells.

WHAT HAVE STUDIES IN EACH COUNTRY SHOWN? Italy A recent Italian study found fewer than five per cent of 441 COVID-19 patients who needed to be admitted to an Italian hospital were smokers. The scientists described it as a 'very low' number, given that a quarter of the general population are known to be hooked on cigarettes. The Italian study led by Dr Nicola Gaibazzi looked at patients admitted to hospital in Parma, Northern Italy. It means the findings can only be applied to those with symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention - thousands of patients escape suffering any symptoms. Information about smoking was taken from medical records, and efforts were made to directly contact the patients or their relatives for confirmation. Previous research on the topic has been full of holes because researchers admit data had been missing. But in this study, a total of 423 out of 441 patients or their relatives were spoken to on the phone, which strengthens the data. Non-smokers made up 85 per cent of deaths, smokers 6 per cent and ex-smokers 9 per cent - which was not significantly different to the total cohort. However, active smokers had a 50/50 chance of survival once hospitalised - 47 per cent of those admitted died. In comparison, just over a third of non-smokers died. China The UCL review included 22 studies conducted in hospitals in China, which showed that 3.8 to 17.6 per cent of COVID-19 patients were current smokers and fewer than five per cent were former smokers. However, 2018 data shows more than half the population of the country are current smokers (50.5 per cent of men and 2.1 per cent of women). And almost one in 10 of non-smokers in China are former smokers (8.4 per cent of men and 0.8 per of women). A separate study published in early April by scientists in New York and Athens looked at 13 Chinese studies that had registered smoking as a precondition and found that the number of smokers across the whole sample of 5,300 patients was 6.5 per cent. It's an astonishingly small number in country where half of all men still smoke. South Korea In one South Korean study looked at by UCL, 18.5 per cent were current smokers, which almost matches the smoking prevalence of 19.3 per cent in 2016. France In a study conducted in France, 7.1 per cent were current smokers, 6.1 per cent of whom were hospitalised. But much higher smoking rates are recorded in the population - 32 per cent. However the results were different for former smokers, of which there are 31.4 per cent in France. A much higher 59.1 per cent of COVID-19 patients were former smokers. UK In the international study with participants predominantly from the UK in a hospital setting, five per cent were current or former smokers. This compares with a current and former smoking prevalence of 14.4 and 25.8 per cent in England in 2018, 'suggesting a lower than expected proportion of current and former smokers in the included study'. US One study conducted by America's Centers for Disease Control of over 7,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus, found that just 1.3 per cent of them were smokers - against the 14 per cent of all Americans that the CDC says smoke. The study also found that the smokers stood no greater chance of ending up in hospital or an ICU. In US studies reviewed by UCL, 1.3 to 27.2 per cent were current smokers, in contrast to a smoking prevalence of 13.8 per cent in 2018. And 2.3 to 30.6 per cent were former smokers, compared with the 20.9 per cent of former smokers across the states. Similarly, data published in the The New England Journal of Medicine from New York City, the epicentre of the US epidemic, shows just 5.1 per cent of patients are smokers.

The coronavirus enters cells inside the body via the structures, which coat the surface of some cells, including in the airways and lungs.

If nicotine does lowers ACE-2 expression, it makes it harder for viral particles to gain entry into cells and therefore cause an infection.

On the other hand, other studies show that nicotine enhances the action of the ACE-2 receptor, which in theory, puts smokers at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus.

However, it seems that up-regulation of ACE2 may in fact be protective against disease severity.

The virus is known to cause lung damage by depleting the numbers of ACE-2 receptors. So if smoking increases them, it could reverse the effect and prevent harm to the lungs.

Dr Davies said in the BMJ letter that COVID-19 patients who smoked were suffering acute lung injury, which he and colleagues believe is a result of nicotine withdrawal.

Other scientists say low levels of ACE-2 expression as a result of nicotine may prevent worse damage from viral infection, and there is no evidence that says higher quantities of ACE-2 receptors increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first place.

Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos, from the University of West Attica, Greece, who queried whether nicotine could be a cure for COVID-19 in a paper published on May 9, said: 'Up-regulation of ACE2, though seemingly paradoxical, may in fact protect patients from severe disease and lung injury.'

A 2008 study in mice found that getting rid of ACE-2 made the animals more likely to suffer severe breathing difficulties when infected with the SARS virus, which is almost identical to COVID-19.

There is a high degree of uncertainty around the links between ACE-2 receptors and nicotine.

Other scientists have turned their head towards nicotine's ability to prevent inflammation, where evidence is more robust.

Nicotine has been shown inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1 and IL-6, which are involved in promoting an inflammatory response.

A 'cytokine storm' is a phenomenon in which an abundance of cytokines are released in response to infection.

Doctors have previously said that it's often the body's response to the virus, rather than the virus itself, that plays a major role in how sick a person gets.

A cytokine storm can lead to respiratory failure and the attack of healthy tissues, causing multi-organ failure.

Therefore, the cytokine storm is being looked at as a target for COVID-19 treatment.

Drugs like the arthritis medication tocilizumab, which doctors say has the potential to stop the cytokine storm, is part of three major trials involving British patients - with the first results expected by June or July.

Tocilizumab blocks the effects of the IL-6, and has become a go-to for inflammatory disease treatment for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.

'Nicotine has effects on the immune system that could be beneficial in reducing the intensity of the cytokine storm,' Dr Farsalinos wrote in Internal and Emergency Medicine.

'The potential benefits of nicotine.... could explain, at least in part, the increased severity or adverse outcome among smokers hospitalized for COVID-19 since these patients inevitably experience abrupt cessation of nicotine intake during hospitalization.

'This may be feasible through repurposing already approved pharmaceutical nicotine products such as nicotine patches.'

Dr Nicola Gaibazzi, who recently published findings on MedRxiv of 'very low' numbers of smokers in Italian COVID-19 patients, speculates smoke exposure may bolster the immune system.

He said exposure to cigarette smoke reduces the body's immune system over time, measured by lower inflammatory markers.

Therefore, when smokers are infected with a virus like SARS-CoV-2, their immune system is more 'tolerant' and does not overreact.

On the other hand, non-smokers may be more prone to having the sudden and deadly cytokine storm when they are infected with the virus.

Dr Gaibazzi and authors wrote: 'Patients admitted with COVID-19 to an Italian hospital heavily involved in the recent outbreak showed a disproportionately low prevalence of active smokers compared with the general population.

'The current study is useful since it suggests that smokers may carry some type of protective mechanism from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.'

Scientists have stressed that the evidence supporting nicotine as a medicine does not mean everyone should take up smoking

This could backfire because there is a well established link between smoking and comorbidities like heart disease and cancer, which in themselves are risks for severe COVID-19 or death.

What evidence is there that smokers may be protected from the coronavirus?

WHAT IS AN ACE-2 RECEPTOR AND WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH COVID-19? ACE-2 receptors are structures found on the surface of cells in the lungs and airways which work with an enyzme called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) to regulate blood pressure. Its exact function in the lungs is not well understood but studies suggest it is protective against lung damage and low levels of it can worsen the impact of viral infections. Scientists say that the coronavirus which causes COVID-19 enters the body through the ACE-2 receptor, which the shape of it allows it to latch on to. This means that someone with more ACE-2 receptors may be more susceptible to a large viral load - first infectious dose of a virus - entering their bloodstream. ACE-2 receptors have a shape which matches the outside of the coronavirus, effectively providing it with a doorway into the bloodstream, scientists say People who have higher than usual numbers of ACE-2 receptors may include those with diabetes or high blood pressure because they have genetic defects which make them produce more. Emerging evidence shows that smokers may also produce more. High levels of ACE-2 receptors may also be protective, however. They are thought to be able to protect the lungs during infection and a study on mice in 2008 found that mice which had ACE-2 blocked in their bodies suffered more damage when they were infected with SARS, which is almost identical to COVID-19. Smoking has in the past been repeatedly linked to lower than normal levels of ACE-2 receptors, potentially increasing the risk of lung damage from COVID-19.

Researchers have repeatedly uncovered evidence that smokers could be protected from the deadly coronavirus.

Experts are struggling to knock down mounting evidence that suggests an apparent protective effect from cigarettes.

Typically, smokers are at a heightened risk of infection because the tiny hairs inside the airways and lungs, which help move pathogens and mucus away, are often damaged by the toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke.

In theory, this would put smokers at a disadvantage if they catch coronavirus, considering the disease leaves patients unable to get enough oxygen into the bloodstream due to lung inflammation.

But data from across the world is showing otherwise - that smokers are protected from infection in some way.

Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, has admitted 'there's something weird going on with smoking and coronavirus'.

She told Good Morning Britain on April 28: 'We know for decades that smoking is linked to a higher risk of developing respiratory conditions and also people who smoke have poorer outcomes.'

And a leading infectious disease expert at University College London, Professor Francois Balloux, has also previously said there is 'bizarrely strong' evidence smoking may be protective.

University College London academics looked at 28 papers and found the proportions of smokers among hospital patients were 'lower than expected'.

Their paper was titled 'The association of smoking status with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19: A living rapid evidence review' and was published on the study-sharing website Qeios.

David Simons and colleagues looked at 28 studies involving more than 23,000 people.

Twenty-two of the studies were conducted in China, three in the US, one in South Korea, one in France and one was an international study using mostly UK data.

The study from the US suggested that smokers appear to be less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with never smokers.

Rather than this reflecting likelihood of catching the virus in the first place, it is more likely to point to someone's risk of becoming so ill they have to go to hospital. Most of the countries involved in the studies did almost all of their testing in hospitals.

But the researchers noted that smokers were more likely to be tested, possibly because their symptoms, like a cough, are more obvious due to their habit.

Two high quality studies provided zero evidence that the 657 current or former smokers with the virus were at a higher risk of ending up in hospital.

But when smokers do get diagnosed with the virus, however, they appear to be more likely to get so sick that they need ventilation.

That's according to two other studies, involving 1,370 people hospitalised people. Smokers were 43 per cent more likely to see their disease progress to become severe than those who had never smoked.

Three studies reported death rates from COVID-19 but there 'did not appear to be a notable difference' between smokers and non-smokers.

However, the studies 'did not explicitly state never smoking status', the authors said. They implied that patients who died may have smoked in the past, but this was not clearly recorded by a doctor.

The authors concluded there is a lack of evidence that meets a high standard to definitely say whether or not smokers are at higher risk of catching the coronavirus, or having poor outcomes.

'Notwithstanding these uncertainties, compared with national prevalence estimates, recorded current and former smoking rates in the included studies were generally lower than expected,' the study authors wrote.

The first review of evidence on smoking was conducted in March, when there were very few studies.

But still, the team led by Harvard's Dr Constantine Vardavas came to the conclusion that smokers do face a greater risk of suffering complications - but are less likely to be infected in the first place.

They reviewed five studies, publishing their findings the journal Tobacco Induced Diseases, and said so far say the proof smoking raises the risk of coronavirus is limited, after finding as little as 1.4 per cent of hospitalised patients were smokers.

All of the five studies reviewed looked at either the risk of infection, disease progression or death among smokers in Chinese patients.

The largest of them all, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February, involved 1,099 patients.

Of the 173 patients who had severe symptoms, 16.9 per cent of them were current smokers and 5.2 per cent had previously smoked.

In comparison, of the patients with less-severe symptoms, 11.8 per cent were current smokers and 1.3 per cent were former smokers.

In a group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit, or ultimately died, a quarter were current smokers – more than twice the rate than in patients who did not have such adverse outcomes.

It confirmed the findings of a smaller study in Wuhan which showed more than ten per cent of COVID-19 patients who were severely ill were either smokers or former smokers.

A large study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that of 173 patients who had severe symptoms, 16.9 per cent of them were current smokers and 5.2 per cent had previously smoked. In comparison, of the patients with less-severe symptoms, 11.8 per cent were current smokers and 1.3 per cent were former smokers

In comparison, of those with milder symptoms, none we current smokers. Just under four per cent had smoked previously, the findings in Allergy show.

Another study of 191 patients, published in The Lancet, showed a higher proportion of smokers among victims (nine per cent) than survivors (four per cent).

But not all the evidence suggests a negative prognosis for smokers. A study published in The Lancet made no connection between serious COVID-19 illness and smokers.

Among 41 patients, none of the 13 who needed to be admitted to intensive care were current smokers, the team in Wuhan said. But there were smokers in the group who fared better.

Similarly, researchers at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University - whose work was not included in the meta-analysis - were mystified after finding smokers were less likely to catch the deadly virus in the first place.

They made the conclusion that only 1.4 per cent of 140 hospitalised patients were smokers.

Writing in the journal The Lancet, the researchers added: 'The exact underlying causes of the lower incidence of COVID‐19 in current smokers are still unknown.'

But they admitted: 'The outcome of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in smokers may be more severe.'

A study of 41 patients found that none of the 13 patients who needed to be admitted to ICU were current smokers. In contrast, 11 per cent (three) of those who did not need intensive care were smokers

Researchers at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University made the conclusion that only 1.4 per cent of 140 hospitalised patients were smokers

One study of 140 coronavirus patients found that among the 58 patients who severely ill, 3.4 per cent (two people) were current smokers and 6.9 per cent (four) were former smokers. In comparison, of the 82 with milder symptoms, none were current smokers and 3.7 per cent (three) were former smokers

Although further research is warranted, smoking is 'most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19', the Harvard team concluded in the journal Tobacco Induced Diseases.

The experts admitted warnings made by health chiefs were based mainly on assumptions, given the known infection risks of smoking.

It came as Public Health England urged against smoking amid the coronavirus pandemic. The body said in early April to kick the habit because the virus attacks the respiratory system, 'which explains why smokers are at greater risk'.

It pointed to one 'small but highly impactful survey' which took place at The Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Wuhan is the city where the pandemic began in December.

Doctors followed 78 COVID-19 patients with pneumonia for two weeks, to assess how their health profile affected their outcomes. The findings were published in the Chinese Medical Journal.

The patients whose conditions worsened had a 'significantly' higher number smokers compared to the patients who got better – 27 per cent compared three per cent.

Researchers who led the study also concluded that a history of smoking was a risk factor for disease progression, increasing the odds by 14 times.",15,Low,Right

People who are wrongly told they don't have the virus when in fact they do - called a 'false negative' - could be spreading the disease if they think they are safe to return to work.

False negative results would mainly be the fault of incorrect swabbing, experts say. Health chiefs have also admitted the test itself, called a PCR test, is 'not perfect'.

Health workers are trained on how to swab a potentially infected person, while home kits come with instructions - but experts say there are bound to be mistakes.

Scientists say it is 'dangerous' to rely on test results to solely steer the handling of the pandemic, in which at least 34,600 Britons have died.

They argue symptoms should not be brushed aside just because a person has a negative result and they should be told to self isolate just in case.

It follows warnings to ministers that up to one in four COVID-19 cases will be missed because the symptom list is not broad enough.

Health chiefs in the UK told the public to look out for a cough and high temperature for months.

But by missing out aching muscles, loss of taste and smell and headaches, experts fear Britain will not get a grip on the crisis.

Nasopharyngeal swabs are the preferred choice of testing for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide because it collects the most concentrated sample. A long flexible cotton bud is supposed to be inserted deep into the nostril and along the nose 'floor' to collect a mucus sample. But the invasive test is so uncomfortable it's been described like 'being stabbed in the brain'

There have been almost 2.5million tests across the UK so far, according to the Department of Health, of which 240,161 have been positive.

Some 40 per cent of tests have been repeat tests to clarify if someone has got rid of the virus, for example when a patient leaves hospital.

Public Health England have not revealed how many test results could be incorrect.

But experts believe false negatives are in the region of 10 to 30 per cent.

Lawrence Young, a virologist and infectious disease expert at Warwick University told MailOnline: 'I'm guessing around 30 per cent of results are a false negative.

'That means for every 100 people you test that are positive, 30 will come out as negative.'

Tens of thousands more people are having swab tests now than at the start of the outbreak as the Government ramps up capacity.

Despite the surge in test numbers, ministers have boasted that daily new cases are levelling off as a sign the outbreak is slowing.

But Professor Young asks: 'Are we accounting for up to 30 per cent of samples we are testing that is negative is actually a positive?

WHAT IS THE SWAB TEST FOR CORONAVIRUS? Nasopharyngeal swabs are used to detect respiratory viruses, such as the flu and the new coronavirus. It is the preferred choice for SARS-CoV-2 testing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It involves inserting a long, flexible cotton bud into the nostril and along the nose 'floor'. This is supposed to be done slowly so that it is comfortable. The aim is to reach the posterior nasopharynx, a cavity made up of muscle and connective tissue, covered in cells and mucous that are similar to the nose. It continues down into the throat. The swab is rotated several times in order to get enough cells. The sample is then sent to a lab, where it will be tested to determine if the patient’s cells are infected with the virus. The coronavirus is a RNA virus, which means it uses ribonucleic acid as its genetic material. A process called reverse transcription is needed to transcribe the RNA into readable DNA. A swab sample doesn't collect much RNA in one go, therefore a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to rapidly make billions of copies so it can be analysed. The DNA is dyed a fluorescent colour, which glows if the coronavirus is present, confirming a diagnosis. Advertisement

'False negatives are for several reasons, but probably the main reason is a sampling error. It's always concerned me and many colleagues there is an issue with swabbing and I think some errors will creep in.'

Nasopharyngeal swabs are the preferred choice of testing for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide because it collects the most concentrated sample.

A long flexible cotton bud is supposed to be inserted deep into the nostril and along the nose 'floor' to collect a mucus sample.

The aim is to reach the posterior nasopharynx, a cavity made up of muscle and connective tissue, covered in cells and mucous. It continues down into the throat.

But the invasive test is so uncomfortable it's been described like 'being stabbed in the brain'. It can cause people to gag and suffer nosebleeds.

The alternative is to take two swabs; one from the nostril and another of the back of the throat through the mouth.

Home testing kits - of which some 35,000 are currently being sent out per day to key workers and their household members - use this method.

Studies from early in the outbreak in China have suggested that test results vary depending on the type and the day the swab is taken in the course of the disease.

One study, published on MedRxiv, showed nasal swabs correctly identified only 73 per cent of severe COVID-19 cases and 72 per cent of mild cases in the first week of symptoms.

The positive rate of throat swabs was even lower, around 60 per cent. When throat swabs were collected more than eight days after symptoms, the positive rate dropped to 50 per cent in severe and 29.6 per cent in mild cases.

Eight days may seem like a long wait for a test. But in the UK, accessing tests has shown to be challenging. Home test kits and slots at facilities have been selling out within minutes online.

Professor Young, who emphasised that nasopharyngeal swabs collect a stronger sample, said he believes there is an 'enormous variability' in how swabs are being collected, both at home and at drive-through testing facilities across the UK.

'You have to go deep into the nose. When you look at some pictures [of testing facilities], that's not happening,' he warned.

'If you're going to make judgements on one swab test, you have to be very careful especially if you are telling people if they can go back to work.'

Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine and infectious disease scientist at University of East Anglia said relying on test results is 'dangerous'.

He told MailOnline: 'What I'm worried about is if you've got symptoms, and the test comes back as negative, you can go out. That is dangerous because you get a lot of false negatives with the PCR test.

'I think it's dangerous, and it will get more dangerous, if the government continues to rely on test results as cases decline. Because a wrong result could lead to wider spread, particularly if the person is a super spreader.

Professor Hunter said he 'believes clinical symptoms as well as the test result are important in assessing risk'.

Similarly, Nick Summerton, a GP in East Yorkshire, has raised concerns that people who tested negative were not being sufficiently warned that they might have the disease.

He told The Sunday Times: 'On most days I come across a person who has ""barn door"" COVID-19 symptoms but a negative result.

'They often know as well as I do that this must be a false negative, but the post-test guidance is pretty useless in helping them with this.'

The most common symptoms of the virus are a persistent cough and high temperature. These are the only signs listed by the NHS and are what Public Health England insists a person must have in order to access a test.

Dr Summerton, who has also acted as an advisor to the Government during the pandemic, has called for symptoms such as tiredness, breathlessness and loss of appetite to be included in key symptom list for Britain.

He said the public may be reassured they don't have the coronavirus if they look at the NHS website, therefore unwillingly go around spreading it to others.

He warned the UK will fail to get 'a grip on the epidemic' by ignoring the presence of symptoms which may have previously been seen as uncommon, The Sunday Times reported last week.

Compared with adults, children are less likely to have the tell-tale symptoms and may not show any signs of the virus at all. Pictured: Around 73 per cent of US children have a fever, cough or shortness of breath, compared with 93 per cent of adults

WHAT SYMPTOMS DO HEALTH OFFICIALS LIST? CDC'S PREVIOUS AND CURRENT LIST OF CORONAVIRUS SYMPTOMS NHS The NHS lists the following as the main symptoms of the coronavirus: a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature) a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual) It also says to use the NHS 111 service if you have those symptoms The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Until recently, the CDC only listed three symptoms of coronavirus on its website: Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath Last week, the CDC expanded its list to include the following signs: Chills

Repeated shaking with chills

Muscle pain

Headache

Sore throat

New loss of taste or smell The World Health Organization Most common symptoms: Fever

Dry cough

Tiredness Less common symptoms: Aches and pains

Sore throat

Diarrhoea

Conjunctivitis

Headache

Loss of taste or smell

A rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toe Serious symptoms: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath

Chest pain or pressure

Loss of speech or movement

Ministers have been warned that the virus may be undetected in a quarter of cases because they exhibit symptoms of the virus other than a cough and fever, The Telegraph reports.

Scientists on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) expressed concern that people with only lesser known symptoms may not be self isolating or getting access to a test.

They raised issues at a Nervtag meeting on March 13, the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson first told the public to self isolate if they developed a cough or high temperature.

According to minutes of the meeting, John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, pointed towards a paper that said 'one in four cases could be missed if the criteria of only a cough and/or fever are used'.

The minutes of the meeting said: 'There was concern that the phraseology might mean that a number of individuals with the virus may not meet the definition.'

Research has pointed towards an array of symptoms SARS-CoV-2 can cause beyond the typical cough and fever. Sometimes these depend on the severity of disease.

On March 31, King's College London researchers said almost 60 per cent of coronavirus patients experienced a loss of taste and smell.

They collected data of more than 1.5million Britons who downloaded the COVID Symptom Tracker App.

Some 59 per cent of those who reported their health by March 29 and tested positive reported a loss of smell and taste, compared with 18 per cent of those who tested negative.

But the Government discarded loss of smell and taste - which Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he suffered with during his illness - as 'anecdotal evidence' on April 3.

The World Health Organization lists 13 symptoms of COVID-19 and the CDC bumped its up to nine in recent weeks.

Both acknowledge muscle pain, loss of taste and smell and headaches as typical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, who sits on Nervtag, said it was important patients and doctors broadened their perception of how the coronavirus presents itself in different people.

He said: 'In the self reported symptoms, the loss of sense of smell comes out as a very, very frequent one.

'But in terms of how often that would actually lead to a diagnosis of COVID, that’s not quite clear.

'The original, very restrictive definition, I think, was not picking up a lot of people who actually might have COVID.'

Professor Openshaw confirmed that one in four cases could still 'easily' be missed as a result of the focus on coughing and high temperatures.

MailOnline have contacted The Department of Health and Public Health England for comment.

Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England said: 'The UK testing system is built on strong foundations using the latest evidence and expert advice. There are many studies currently ongoing into the accuracy of the COVID-19 test and a number of different methods are available to assess this. However, there is no such thing as a perfect test.

'We have made every effort to make testing as strong as possible in line with our high standards.'",15,Low,Right

Britain will get first access to a coronavirus vaccine being developed by Oxford University with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca poised to make 30 million for the UK by September - if it works.

Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, today announced a deal has been done between the university and the company to manufacture the vaccine which is currently in clinical trials.

He pledged an additional £84 million to accelerate the development of the vaccine - on top of a previous £47 million pot of cash - so that mass production can start as soon as possible if it is proved to be effective.

Mr Sharma said the Oxford project is 'progressing well' and that another vaccine effort by Imperial College London is 'also making good progress'.

However, he cautioned that despite the growing optimism there are 'no certainties' and there may never be a vaccine developed capable of tackling the deadly disease.

Mr Sharma also revealed that six drugs designed to treat coronavirus have now entered initial live clinical trials. The world is yet to identify a drug clinically proven to treat the disease.

The vaccine announcement came as Mr Sharma said the UK Covid-19 death toll had now reached 34,636 after a further 170 deaths today. That is the smallest increase since the start of lockdown.

UK coronavirus death toll rises by 170 - the lowest increase since the start of lockdown Britain has announced a further 170 deaths from coronavirus today on the first Sunday since draconian lockdown measures were eased, taking the UK's total death toll to 34,636. The latest daily figure is the lowest since March 24, however numbers released on Sunday are usually smaller due to a delay in processing over the weekend. Speaking in today's daily Downing Street briefing, Business Secretary Alok Sharma also confirmed that there have been 3,142 more Covid-19 cases. The drop in death toll marks a 36.8 per cent decrease on last Sunday's 269 figure. The numbers follow a tumultuous week for the Government in which approval ratings took a sharp dip after Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out his strategy for lifting lockdown measures. In this evening's briefing, which was delayed by 30 minutes, Mr Sharma has said the clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine at the University of Oxford is progressing well. Advertisement

The vaccine announcement made by Mr Sharma came as:

Michael Gove initially guaranteed that teachers would be safe at reopening schools before swiftly backtracking and admitting there will be a 'risk'.

Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organisation, said world data on the return of schools is 'very reassuring'.

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she supported councils which are not planning to reopen schools to all pupils on June 1 for safety reasons.

Mr Gove has said there are 'big lessons' to be learned from the treatment of care homes during the coronavirus outbreak.

The Minister for the Cabinet Office revealed 17,000 contact tracers have now been recruited, putting the Government on track to hit its 18,000 target.

Mr Johnson told Tory MPs he wants to return to 'near-normality' in July.

Mr Johnson and Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, were said to have had a 'tense' stand off over who is responsible for implementing the lockdown exit strategy.

Britons flocked to parks and beaches as temperatures moved towards 70F in the nation's first Sunday since lockdown measures were loosened.

The COVID-19 trials are taking place at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford and started on April 23. A second vaccine from Imperial College London is also hoped to face human trials in June.

A working vaccine is viewed as likely the only surefire way for the world to go back to something resembling normal life.

Mr Sharma last month announced the creation of a new vaccine task force to bring together the Government, universities and industry in the hope that the UK could lead the way in developing a vaccine.

The Business Secretary said he was 'very proud' of how quickly different sectors had united for the 'critical mission' with the Oxford and Imperial programmes emerging as 'two of the world’s frontrunners'.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VACCINES CREATED BY OXFORD AND IMPERIAL COLLEGE? The science behind both vaccine attempts hinges on recreating the 'spike' proteins that are found all over the outside of the COVID-19 viruses. Both will attempt to recreate or mimic these spikes inside the body. The difference between the two is how they achieve this effect. Imperial College London will try to deliver genetic material (RNA) from the coronavirus which programs cells inside the patient's body to recreate the spike proteins. It will transport the RNA inside liquid droplets injected into the bloodstream. The team at the University of Oxford, on the other hand, will genetically engineer a virus to look like the coronavirus - to have the same spike proteins on the outside - but be unable to cause any infection inside a person. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. If the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person's bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future. The same process is thought to happen in people who catch COVID-19 for real, but this is far more dangerous - a vaccine will have the same end-point but without causing illness in the process.

The Oxford vaccine is now in its first clinical trial and all phase one participants have now received their vaccine dose and are being monitored by the clinical trial team.

Mr Sharma said: 'The speed with which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.

‘Imperial College are also making good progress and will be looking to move into clinical trials by mid-June with larger scale trials planned to begin in October.

‘So far the Government has invested £47 million in the Oxford and Imperial vaccine programmes.

‘But today I can announce an additional £84 million of new Government funding to help accelerate their work.

‘This new money will help mass produce the Oxford vaccine so that if current trials are successful we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.

‘The funding will also allow Imperial to launch phase three clinical trials for its vaccine later this year.

‘I can also confirm that with Government support Oxford University has finalised a global licensing agreement with AstraZeneca for the commercialisation and manufacturing of the Oxford vaccine.

‘This means that if the vaccine is successful, AstraZeneca will work to make 30 million doses available by September for the UK as part of an agreement to deliver 100 million doses in total.

‘The UK will be first to get access and we can also ensure that in addition to supporting people here in the UK we are able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost.’

The fact that a deal has already been done between Oxford University and AstraZeneca will boost hopes that its vaccine has a good chance at success.

But Mr Sharma urged the nation to remain cautiously hopeful as he said ultimately both projects could fail.

He told the daily Downing Street press conference: ‘In total the Government has now committed a quarter of a billion pounds towards developing a vaccine in the UK.

Michael Gove today initially guaranteed the safety of returning teachers before then admitting that there will be some 'risk'

‘But there are no certainties. In spite of the tireless efforts of our scientists it is possible that we may never find a successful coronavirus vaccine.’

Boris Johnson and Sir Mark Sedwill clash over lockdown exit plan Boris Johnson and the UK's top civil servant Sir Mark Sedwill clashed over who is responsible for rolling out the Government's lockdown exit strategy, it was claimed today. The Prime Minister and Sir Mark are said to have had a 'tense' standoff when the plans to ease restrictions were being discussed at a meeting last week. Mr Johnson apparently asked the room who was responsible for actually implementing the measures contained within the blueprint. He asked Sir Mark if it was him, but the head of the Civil Service replied it was up to the PM to make sure things happen. The claims came amid reports of growing splits between ministers and senior civil servants. Mandarins fear they are being lined as coronavirus 'fall guys' ahead of an inevitable public inquiry into the Government's handling of the crisis. Meanwhile, a plan to quarantine travellers returning to the UK has prompted a Cabinet split over who it should apply to with aides concerned it is rapidly becoming a 'sh**show'.

Mr Sharma also revealed work is progressing on efforts to produce drugs which effectively treat coronavirus.

He said: 'Whilst there are currently no drugs in the world that have been clinically proven to treat coronavirus, the Government is working with our scientists and medical experts to identify promising candidates.

'This collaborative UK programme known as Accord aims to get an early indication of drug treatments' effectiveness in treating coronavirus.

'Today I can report that six drugs have now entered initial live clinical trials.

'If positive results are seen they will advance into larger scale trials.'

Mr Sharma's comments at the daily press conference came after his Cabinet colleague Michael Gove initially guaranteed teachers will be safe when schools reopen before swiftly backtracking to insist 'you can never eliminate risk'.

The Government is locked in a furious row with councils and teaching unions over its plans to begin the phased reopening of primary schools in England from June 1 as the coronavirus lockdown is eased.

Some teaching unions are blocking the move and have said they will only budge once they are persuaded it is totally safe for teachers and children to go back to the classroom.

But others have said they will recommend reopening after talks with Government experts.

Michael Gove reveals more than 17,000 contact tracers have now been recruited Michael Gove today revealed the Government has recruited more than 17,000 coronavirus contact tracers putting ministers on track to hit their 18,000 target. The staff will play a key role in efforts to prevent a second wave of the deadly disease as they are tasked with figuring out where people who test positive have been and who they may have come into contact with. Mr Gove's announcement came just days after his fellow Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said the Government had only managed to recruit people for 1,500 of the roles. However, there are concerns about the long term future of the 'test, track and trace' programme after it was claimed staff are only being hired on initial three month contracts. Health experts believe such a scheme will need to be in place for as long as 18 months.

Meanwhile, a number of local authorities have said they will not comply with Boris Johnson's lockdown strategy and will exercise caution when it comes to reopening schools.

Mr Gove, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, was asked this morning during an appearance on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if teachers should be safe when returning to work.

He replied: 'Yes, teachers will be safe in schools. The programme that has been outlined is a staged and careful return with children in reception, year one and year six of primary coming back to school we hope in the week beginning June 1.

'It is the case that some of the best leaders in current education have said that it is absolutely safe for children to return, absolutely safe for teachers and other staff to return as well.'

Asked if he could guarantee that teachers will be safe, he said: 'Yes. It is the case, as I say, I talked to the chief scientific adviser yesterday for the government Patrick Vallance and running through the figures, the R number, the rate of infection in the community overall, we are confident that children and teachers will be safe.'

However, when asked directly if he could guarantee that no returning teacher will catch coronavirus at school, Mr Gove said: 'The only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely.

A new survey conducted by Opinium found more people now disapprove of the Government's handling of the crisis than approve for the first time since the outbreak started

Paths in Hampstead Heath, London, were bustling with people who took to the outdoors on the first weekend since lockdown measures were lifted

Although pubs are yet to reopen, many revellers found their way around the rules as they headed out in the sunshine today to enjoy drinks at beach bars in Brighton (pictured)

'There is always, always, always in any loosening of these restrictions a risk of people catching the coronavirus.'

He continued: 'The key thing is that we can make these workplaces safe. You can never eliminate risk but as we know, as we have heard, it is the case that it is extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak and if for any reason there are risks then we can take steps to mitigate them.'

It came as the Government saw its approval rating take a sharp dip in the week after the Prime Minister set out his strategy for lifting lockdown measures.

A new Opinium survey showed that disapproval for the PM's response to the outbreak is now higher than approval for the very first time.

Some 39 per cent of the nation are supportive of the Government's handling of the crisis, down nine points on the 48 per cent recorded last week, while disapproval rose from 36 per cent to 42 per cent.

WHAT IS THE OXFORD VACCINE AND WHO CAN GET ONE? What type of vaccine is it? The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) from chimpanzees that has been genetically changed so it is impossible for it to grow in humans. The intellectual rights to its vaccine are owned by the University of Oxford and a spin-out company called Vaccitech. Clinical teams at the Oxford University's Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group began developing the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in January. It's a type of immunisation known as a recombinant viral vector vaccine. Researchers place genetic material from the coronavirus into another virus that’s been modified. They will then inject the virus into a human, hoping to produce an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. If the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person's bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future. It was developed so rapidly by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, and her team because they already had a base vaccine for similar coronaviruses. The team have gone through stages of vaccine development that usually take five years in just four months. However, Professor Gilbert said that none of the normal safety steps had been missed out. What stage of testing is it at? The Oxford vaccine trial started testing its ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine on humans on April 23. The Phase I clinical trial will study safety and efficacy in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, across five trial centres in Southern England. It has recruited 1,100 people, half of whom will receive the vaccine and the other half (the control group) receiving a widely available meningitis vaccine. This is technically known as phase two of a vaccine trial, where the scientists test the vaccine against a placebo and work out the correct dosage. The first phase, which is a safety run where a small number of people are given the dose to see how the body reacts, is being run at the same time. If this work is successful, it will move forward into studies to see if the vaccine works against the real virus spreading in the community. Normally phase three - the final stage of testing - involves hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people across multiple sites for a long period of time. So far 'several hundred' people have been vaccinated in the study, Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University told BBC Radio 4. Who has had it? A family who are taking part in the trial have revealed what it was like to get the vaccine. Mother-of-four Katie, 46, took part in the groundbreaking trial with her husband Tony, 53, and daughter Rhiannon Viney, 19. All three have not reported any reactions since having the jab. None of them know whether they have received the coronavirus vaccine or the placebo meningitis one. But time will tell if it will protect them from catching the virus from someone. A family from Oxford who are taking part in the first coronavirus vaccine trial have said it was their duty to take part Katie told The Express: 'I don't think any of us feels like we have done anything remarkable - we just wanted to do something to help, anything. I just thought of all the children at my school who are missing their friends and are desperate to return to some sort of normality.' She added: 'We didn't hesitate to participate. We have done our bit for Britain and we are proud.' Tony said: 'When you think that at any one time there are four billion people in lockdown around the world it is trials like this that could help.' Katie said she was not worried about any health risks from taking part in the trial because she believes the team have done everything they could to make it safe. She added: 'Lots of people are being very negative about it, but it is going to be safe, they are not going to take the risk with people's lives.' Will it be successful? Professor Gilbert has been vocal about her confidence in the vaccine. She acknowledged nobody can be 'completely certain' that it is possible to find a vaccine for Covid-19, but the prospects are 'very good'. In an interview with The Times before trials began, Professor Gilbert told the paper she is '80 per cent' confident of its success, 'based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine'. University of Oxford scientists are confident they can get the jab for the incurable virus rolled out for millions to use by autumn. But Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific advisor to the Government, has said expectations for a vaccine need to be tempered. Writing in The Guardian ahead of the Oxford trials, Sir Patrick wrote: 'All new vaccines that come into development are long shots; only some end up being successful, and the whole process requires experimentation. This will take time, and we should be clear it is not a certainty.' The University of Oxford's experimental jab has shown to strengthen the immune system in six rhesus macaques without causing any side effects, it was revealed last week. Within 28 days of being vaccinated, all of the animals had COVID-19 antibodies - produced by the body to give it some immunity from the virus. Some had developed antibodies in two weeks. Researchers said the primates were able to fight off the virus before it penetrated deep into their lungs, where it can become deadly. They found a single vaccination dose was also effective in preventing damage to the lungs in the study on monkeys and mice. Stephen Evans, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the results were 'very definitely' good news. They have not been published in a scientific journal yet. What obstacles will the team face? Some obstacles are expected to emerge while searching for a vaccine. For example, if transmission levels of COVID-19 levels drop in the community, it could hamper the Oxford study. Professor Gilbert has said they may have to continue their trials in other countries where more of the virus is circulating in the community. In this case, it could be at least six months before researchers know if the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine works. If transmission remains high in the UK, the team could get data within a couple of months. Andrew Pollard, who is part of the Oxford team, said there may be hurdles when testing the vaccine on older people. 'For most vaccines the immune system in older adults, particularly those over 70, doesn't make such good responses,' he said. 'If we did see weaker responses in older adults we also have in our plan that we would look at giving additional doses in that age group to try and improve the immune response.' Professor Gilbert had previously said her team needed help manufacturing the jabs, warning the UK did not have the facilities to do it alone, before a deal was struck with AstraZeneca. How does it compare to other vaccines? According to the World Health Organisation, 118 COVID-19 vaccines are in development worldwide as of May 15.. But the UK now joins only the United States and China in beginning human trials. Eight vaccine candidates are now in preclinical trials. The other British vaccine contender was designed by Imperial College London. Volunteers for clinical trials will be recruited to start the study in June. Robin Shattock, a professor of mucosal infection, said the early volunteers would be given low doses of the vaccine to test its safety. Imperial's vaccine uses a different approach to that of Oxford. It will try to deliver genetic material (RNA) from the coronavirus which programs cells inside the patient's body to recreate the spike proteins. It will transport the RNA inside liquid droplets injected into the bloodstream.

Computer code for Prof Lockdown's model which predicted 500,000 would die from Covid-19 and inspired Britain's 'Stay Home' plan is a 'mess which would get you fired in private industry' say data experts

BY VANESSA CHALMERS HEALTH REPORTER and LUKE MAY FOR MAILONLINE

Scientists have levelled a flurry of criticism against Professor Neil Ferguson's modelling which warned 500,000 people could die from coronavirus and prompted Britain to go into lockdown.

Modelling from Imperial College London epidemiologist Professor Ferguson, who stepped down from the government's Sage group at the start of May, has been described as 'totally unreliable' by other experts.

The coding that produced the sobering death figures was impossible to read, and therefore cast doubts on its strength, The Telegraph reported. It is also some 13 years old, it said.

When other scientists have tried to replicate the findings using the same model, they have repeatedly failed to do.

Prof Ferguson's model is understood to have single-handedly triggered a dramatic change in the Government's handling of the outbreak, as they moved away from herd immunity to a lockdown.

Competing scientists' research - whose models produced vastly different results - has been largely discarded, they claim.

Modelling behind Professor Neil Ferguson's claim that 500,000 Brits could die from Covid-19 has been criticised by scientists

David Richards, co-founder of British data technology company WANdisco said the model was a 'buggy mess that looks more like a bowl of angel hair pasta than a finely tuned piece of programming'.

He said: 'In our commercial reality we would fire anyone for developing code like this and any business that relied on it to produce software for sale would likely go bust.'

WHAT DID PROFESSOR FERGUSON'S WORK SAY? The scientific paper published by Professor Ferguson and his colleagues on the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team was credited for persuading Boris Johnson's Government to ramp up their response to the coronavirus. The paper, released on March 17, and titled Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand, predicted that the Government's original plan to 'mitigate' the outbreak instead of trying to stop it could have led to a quarter of a million people dying. Using data from Italy and China, the scientists predicted how different Government measures would have different impacts on the outbreaks. If no action at all had been taken against the coronavirus it would have claimed 510,000 lives, the team's report said. Had the Government stuck with their strategy of trying to 'mitigate' the spread – allowing it to continue but attempting to slow it down – with limited measures such as home isolation for those with symptoms this number would be roughly halved to 260,000. If the strictest possible measures are introduced, the number of deaths over a two-year period will fall below 20,000, the scientists said. Other points in the Imperial College report, titled Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand, included: Lockdown measures could be brought back if the virus resurfaces after this epidemic is over

The coronavirus outbreak is worse than anything the world has seen since the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic

Dramatic measures to suppress an outbreak carry 'enormous social and economic costs which may themselves have significant impact on health and well-being'

Virus transmission happens evenly – one third of cases are caught in the home, one third at work or school, and one third elsewhere in the community

People are thought to be infectious from 12 hours before symptoms start, or from four days after catching the infection if someone doesn't get symptoms

Patients who do get symptoms are thought to be 50 per cent more infectious than those who don't

People are thought to develop at least short-term immunity after catching the virus, meaning they can't catch it again

Approximately 4.4 per cent of patients need hospital care. 30 per cent of those need intensive care, and 50 per cent of intensive care patients can be expected to die, according to data from China

The average length of a hospital stay for a coronavirus patient is 10 days – eight days for those who recover quickly; 16 days for those who need intensive care

Today marks a week since Boris Johnson addressed the nation and changed England's coronavirus message from Stay Home to Stay Alert, with 34,636 deaths recorded by the Government.

The easing of measures comes almost two months after Britain was placed in lockdown, with government making the decision on, at least in part, the advice of Imperial College London and Prof Ferguson's model outlining the potential harm coronavirus could do to the country.

On March 17, just days before the country was placed into lockdown, Imperial College London published research titled urging a lockdown to be put in place to stop the virus spreading.

Researchers from the university warned 510,000 people could die from the virus if no action was taken.

Had the Government stuck with their strategy of trying to 'mitigate' the spread – allowing it to continue but attempting to slow it down with limited measures such as home isolation for those with symptoms - this number would be roughly halved to 260,000, the report said.

It showed that mitigation would not be insufficient to prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed by looking at bed capacity.

If the strictest possible measures are introduced – including school closures and mandatory home quarantine – the number of deaths over a two-year period will fall below 20,000, the scientists said.

As a result, the Government announced people should stop travelling, stop socialising and work from home.

But critics have today described the coding used by Imperial as 'totally unreliable'.

John Carmack, an American developer who helped refine the code before the paper was published online, said some parts of the code looked like they were machine translated from Fortran', an old coding language.

After growing pressure, the Imperial team released their code, which simulates homes, offices, schools and people movement, and sceptics were quick to point out it was 13 years old.

Furthermore, when analysing the validity of the staggering death estimates, scientists have claimed that it is almost impossible to reproduce the same results from the same data, using the same code as Imperial, The Telegraph reported.

University of Edinburgh researchers reportedly found bugs when running the model, getting different results when they used different machines, or even the same machines in some cases.

The team reported a 'bug' in the system which was fixed - but specialists in the field remain staggered at how inadequate it is.

Four experienced modellers previously noted the code is 'deeply riddled with bugs', has 'huge blocks of code – bad practice' and is 'quite possibly the worst production code I have ever seen'.

Weeks after the model's grim prediction, the University of Edinburgh's Professor Michael Thursfield criticised Professor Ferguson's record as 'patchy'.

He was referring to Professor Ferguson's predictions in the early 2000s that up to 136,000 people could die from mad cow disease.

The Imperial College team’s modelling led to the culling of 6million livestock and was later criticised by epidemiological experts as severely flawed and a tragedy for rural Britain's economy.

Professor Ferguson stepped down from his role on Sage, the board of scientists advising the government through coronavirus pandemic, at the start of the month after it was revealed he had broken lockdown rules he helped to inspire. Antonia Staats (pictured) visited Professor Ferguson at his London flat while Britons were being told to stay home

The team also predicted 200million could die from bird flu and a further 65,000 from swine flu. The final death toll in each case was in the hundreds.

Dr Konstantin Boudnik, the VP of architecture at WANdisco, told The Telegraph: 'The facts from the early 2000s are just yet another confirmation that their modelling approach was flawed to the core.'

Professor Ferguson defended Imperial’s foot and mouth work, saying they were doing 'modelling in real time' with ‘limited data’. He added: 'I think the broad conclusions reached were still valid.'

The true death toll of COVID-19 has far exceeded what was predicted by Imperial under the total lockdown scenario (20,000 over two years).

The Government's total death toll currently stands at 34,466. Using data that collects death certificates, it is more in the region of 39,000.

The Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team came to their predictions with a number of mathematical calculations.

They looked at the most vulnerable people deemed to be 'at the greatest risk of death,' typically elderly people or those with serious underlying health conditions.

The model simulated transport links, population size, healthcare provisions and social networks to predict how the pandemic would spread.

Professor Ferguson and other Imperial College researchers predicted these measures would reduce demand on the healthcare system while protecting those who were most at risk:

Close schools and universities

Anyone with Covid-19 symptoms should isolate at home for seven days

Anyone living with someone who has shown symptoms should quarantine for 14 days.

Social distancing: 'a broad policy that aims to reduce overall contracts that people make outside the household, school or workplace by three-quarters'

Speaking at the time of the paper publication, Professor Ferguson said: 'No country in the world this far has seen an epidemic that large [250,000 deaths], this is an early extrapolation of an early epidemic that was suppressed in China.

'But we have no reason to believe that's not what would happen if we frankly did nothing, and even if we did all we could to slow, not reverse, the spread, we'd still be looking at a very large number of deaths and the health system being overwhelmed.

'Initially when we came up with these kid of estimates they were viewed as what's called the reasonable worst case.

'But as information has been gathered in recent weeks, from particularly Italy but other countries, it has become increasingly clear that actually this is not the reasonable worst case – it is the most likely scenario.'

He added: 'It is likely such measures – most notably, large scale social distancing – will need to be in place for many months, perhaps until a vaccine becomes available.'

While there was overwhelming praise for the research for triggering a much-needed lockdown, criticism of Professor Ferguson's research was voiced at the time.

Professor John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for North West England, accused No 10 of relying on a ‘little clique’ of researchers and failing to consult a wider pool of academics.

‘These guys are being regarded as demigods,’ he said in April.

‘Here we are talking about science but this research is being given a kind of religious status, like tablets of stone from the mountain.’

When the COVID-19 model was made, it used the best data available at the time - from the outbreaks in China and Italy. Information has largely changed since then.

The model uses a string of assumptions, including that 0.9 per cent of those infected will die.

Research in Germany, the US, Sweden and Finland has since estimated the death toll to be much lower - between 0.19 and 0.79 per cent.

Researchers from Australia settled on an overall estimate of 0.75 per cent after collecting information from 13 global studies.

The figure from the University of Wollongong and James Cook University chimes with data emerging from New York, where random antibody testing last month suggested a quarter of the city of eight million people had been infected with the illness, meaning the 16,000 fatalities equaled a death rate of 0.79.

Other assumptions made by the Imperial team included that children are able to spread infection with equivalent efficiency to adults, although little data exists in this area.

Professor Carl Heneghan and Dr Tom Jefferson at the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine questioned the lockdown policy because the virus may already be more widespread than commonly thought.

Modelling by Oxford’s Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group indicates that COVID-19 reached the UK by mid-January at the latest.

The team's research presents a very different view of the epidemic to the modelling at Imperial College London.

It's findings merely a week after Imperial's suggested the coronavirus had already infected far more people in the UK than scientists had previously estimated — perhaps as much as half the population.

The Oxford results would mean the country had already acquired strong herd immunity because COVID-19 had spread for one or two months before a first case was diagnosed.

The herd immunity strategy was abandoned by Government ministers and reversed to a full-scale lockdown due to the model presented by Imperial.

'I am surprised that there has been such unqualified acceptance of the Imperial model,' said Sunetra Gupta, professor of theoretical epidemiology, who led the Oxford study, told the Financial Times.

Since the Oxford study, however, Government-led research has indicated that no-where near half the population have been infected.

Sir Patrick Vallance, Number 10's chief scientific adviser, revealed recently that around four per cent of Britain and 10 per cent of London has developed antibodies against COVID-19.

The estimate - based on data from antibody testing across the home nations carried out a fortnight ago - means only around 2.64million Brits have had the infection.

Meanwhile, the current level of infection is estimated to be about 0.27 per cent.

The findings came from the first round of random public testing of households by the Office for National Statistics. A total of 33 positive cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed out of a sample of 10,705 people.

England's top statisticians estimate that 0.27 per cent of the population has been infected with COVID-19 on any given day over the past fortnight - equal to around 148,000 people and certainly between 94,000 and 222,000

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said at Thursday's Downing Street briefing that the data represented 'really quite a low level of infection' in the community.

Professor Ferguson stepped down from his role on Sage, the board of scientists advising the government through coronavirus pandemic, at the start of the month after it was revealed he had broken lockdown rules he helped to inspire.

It was revealed Professor Ferguson had invited his lover Antonia Staats to his London flat, while the British public was being told to stay home.

A spokesman from the university's Covid-19 response team said: 'The UK government has never relied on a single disease model to inform decision-making.

'As has been repeatedly stated, decision-making around lockdown was based on a consensus view of the scientific evidence, including several modelling studies by different academic groups.

'Multiple groups using different models concluded that the pandemic would overwhelm the NHS and cause unacceptably high mortality in the absence of extreme social distancing measures.

'Within the Imperial research team we use several models of differing levels of complexity, all of which produce consistent results. We are working with a number of legitimate academic groups and technology companies to develop, test and further document the simulation code referred to.

'However, we reject the partisan reviews of a few clearly ideologically motivated commentators.

'Epidemiology is a not a branch of computer science and the conclusions around lockdown rely not on any mathematical model but on the scientific consensus that COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with an infection fatality ratio exceeding 0.5% in the UK.'",15,Low,Right

Britain has announced a further 170 deaths from coronavirus today on the first Sunday since draconian lockdown measures were eased, taking the UK's total death toll to 34,636.

The latest daily figure is the lowest since March 24, however numbers released on Sunday are usually smaller due to a delay in processing over the weekend.

Speaking in today's daily Downing Street briefing, Business Secretary Alok Sharma also confirmed that there have been 3,142 more Covid-19 cases.

The drop in death toll marks a 36.8 per cent decrease on last Sunday's 269 figure.

The numbers follow a tumultuous week for the Government in which approval ratings took a sharp dip after Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out his strategy for lifting lockdown measures.

In this evening's briefing, which was delayed by 30 minutes, Mr Sharma has said the clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine at the University of Oxford is progressing well.

He said: 'In order to definitively conquer this disease we need to find a safe, workable vaccine.

'Last month I announced a new vaccine task force to co-ordinate the efforts of Government, academia and industry in the critical mission to find a vaccine.

'I'm very proud of how quickly our scientists and researchers have come together in their efforts developing a vaccine that will combat coronavirus.'

He added: 'The first clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine is progressing well with all phase one participants having received their vaccine dose on schedule earlier this week.

'The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.'

Speaking in today's daily Downing Street briefing, Business Secretary Alok Sharma confirmed that a further 170 people have died from coronavirus

The latest figures come as:

Business Secretary Alok Sharma told the daily Downing Street press conference that there had been 170 more coronavirus deaths in the UK today, taking the overall toll to 34,636.

Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organisation, said world data on the return of schools is 'very reassuring'.

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she supported councils which are not planning to reopen schools to all pupils on June 1 for safety reasons.

Mr Gove has said there are 'big lessons' to be learned from the treatment of care homes during the coronavirus outbreak.

The Minister for the Cabinet Office revealed 17,000 contact tracers have now been recruited, putting the Government on track to hit its 18,000 target.

Mr Johnson told Tory MPs he wants to return to 'near-normality' in July.

The PM announced £93m to bring forward the opening of a research centre to fast-track a coronavirus vaccine.

Mr Johnson and Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK's top civil servant, were said to have had a 'tense' stand off over who is responsible for implementing the lockdown exit strategy.

Britons flocked to parks and beaches as temperatures moved towards 70F in the nation's first Sunday since lockdown measures were loosened.

The drop in death toll marks a 36.8 per cent decrease on last Sunday's death toll of 269. Figures released on Sunday are usually lower due to a delay in processing over the weekend

Earlier today, results of a new Opinium survey showed that disapproval for the PM's response to the outbreak is now higher than approval for the very first time.

Some 39 per cent of the nation are supportive of the Government's handling of the crisis, down nine points on the 48 per cent recorded last week, while disapproval rose from 36 per cent to 42 per cent.

Yesterday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson outlined the plans for reception, year 1 and 6 to return from June 1.

The plan has faced mass criticism from from ministers, unions and local authorities alike with Labour MP Rachel Reeves stating this morning that the government 'has got a lot more work' to make sure parents and staff are confident about bringing students back.

Almost a third of negative coronavirus tests could be WRONG, expert warns By VANESSA CHALMERS HEALTH REPORTER FOR MAILONLINE Almost a third of negative coronavirus test results could be wrong, scientists say, leaving thousands believing they are virus free. People who are wrongly told they don't have the virus when in fact they do - called a 'false negative' - could be spreading the disease if they think they are safe to return to work. False negative results would mainly be the fault of incorrect swabbing, experts say. Health chiefs have also admitted the test itself, called a PCR test, is 'not perfect'. Health workers are trained on how to swab a potentially infected person, while home kits come with instructions - but experts say there are bound to be mistakes. Scientists say it is 'dangerous' to rely on test results to solely steer the handling of the pandemic, in which at least 34,466 Britons have died. They argue symptoms should not be brushed aside just because a person has a negative result and they should be told to self isolate just in case. There have been almost 2.5million tests across the UK so far, according to the Department of Health, of which 240,161 have been positive. Some 40 per cent of tests have been repeat tests to clarify if someone has got rid of the virus, for example when a patient leaves hospital. Public Health England have not revealed how many test results could be incorrect. But experts believe false negatives are in the region of 10 to 30 per cent. Two metres is considered a safe distance by health chiefs because the coronavirus predominantly spreads in respiratory droplets in a sneeze or cough. These large droplets fall to the floor due to gravity within a short distance, around one metre, from the person who expelled them. The 'safe' distance is double that in order to optimise protection. Two metres is not a 'magical number' according to John Simpson, a medical director at Public Health England. He said 'there is a duration and distance element to exposure that has to be worked through', as scientists continue to work out how the coronavirus spreads in different conditions. But Professor Robert Dingwall, who sits on the government's scientific advisory body New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, which feeds into SAGE, said the two metre rule 'does not have validity and has never had much of an evidence base', suggesting it is safe to stand closer to someone. He said: 'There may be elements of a job where there is exposure for a short period, the risk is so low it can be managed.' Advertisement

Ms Reeves said the Government has two weeks to put in place the test and trace approach, hold talks with the relevant parties and publish the science before schools are due to welcome more pupils through their gates.

She added: 'The Government has got a lot more work to do to give that confidence that it'll be safe to have more children coming into school in two weeks' time.'

But Michael Gove - the Minister for the Cabinet Office - today guaranteed that teachers and pupils will be safe when schools are reopened before swiftly backtracking as he said 'you can never eliminate risk'.

Some teaching unions are blocking the move and have said they will only budge once they are persuaded it is totally safe for teachers and children to go back to the classroom. But others have said they will recommend reopening after talks with Government experts.

Meanwhile, a number of local authorities - including Hartlepool and Liverpool - have said they will not comply with Boris Johnson's lockdown strategy and will exercise caution when it comes to reopening schools.

When asked about regional differences in the opening of schools, Mr Sharma - at today's coronavirus press briefing - said: 'The reason that we of course have said we want to see primary schools back first is because we all know that early learning is absolutely vital.

'This is aimed at children who are benefiting from getting those core skills of reading, writing, arithmetic and that is why we set out that at the earliest we would do this by June.

'We will continue to have discussions with teachers, head teachers - we want everyone to feel safe but what we have set out is something that we're talking about across the whole country.

'There are academy chains across the country who have said that they will look to return primary school kids to school when the Government says it is safe to do so.'

Mr Gove today tried to assuage concerns as he insisted it will be safe for teachers and students before then performing a screeching U-turn and admitting there will be at least some level of risk.

The Government's schools plan will see reception, year one and year six pupils return in June with other year groups returning later.

Secondary schools are not due to reopen before the summer holidays but pupils in year 10 and year 12 will be offered time with teachers ahead of them entering their exam year.

Mr Gove was asked this morning during an appearance on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if teachers should be safe when returning to work.

He replied: 'Yes, teachers will be safe in schools. The programme that has been outlined is a staged and careful return with children in reception, year one and year six of primary coming back to school we hope in the week beginning June 1.

'It is the case that some of the best leaders in current education have said that it is absolutely safe for children to return, absolutely safe for teachers and other staff to return as well.'

Asked if he could guarantee that teachers will be safe, he said: 'Yes. It is the case, as I say, I talked to the chief scientific adviser yesterday for the government Patrick Vallance and running through the figures, the R number, the rate of infection in the community overall, we are confident that children and teachers will be safe.'

However, when asked directly if he could guarantee that no returning teacher will catch coronavirus at school, Mr Gove said: 'The only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely.

'There is always, always, always in any loosening of these restrictions a risk of people catching the coronavirus.'

He continued: 'The key thing is that we can make these workplaces safe. You can never eliminate risk but as we know, as we have heard, it is the case that it is extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak and if for any reason there are risks then we can take steps to mitigate them.'

Spending a few seconds one metre from a colleague is equivalent to an hour two metres away By VANESSA CHALMERS HEALTH REPORTER FOR MAILONLINE Spending a few seconds one metre from a colleague is equivalent to an hour two metres away, and talking loudly makes it worse, it's been warned. Government scientific advisors are considering telling workers exactly how strong the risk of catching the coronavirus is depending on how close they stand next to someone. The fresh advice would help employees 'manage' their risk of the killer infection where social distancing is difficult. Companies are wrestling with new safety rules to allow employees to return to work as Prime Minister Boris Johnson sets out steps to restart the economy. Social distancing is paramount, but there are growing concerns this won't be possible for some employees in confined spaces, including construction site workers. Ministers are hoping for a gradual re-opening of schools from June 1, but there are fears children will be unable to properly social distance. It follows a study last week that showed talking loudly for just one minute can produce a high load of viral particles that stay in the air for eight minutes. Other simulations show how far infected particles from a cough or sneeze can travel in confined spaces. Employers in the UK have been told to re-design workspaces to ensure workers are at a two metre distance from others as much as possible. The new 'COVID-19 secure' guidance covers eight workplace settings which are allowed to be open, including construction sites, factories and takeaways. Where social distancing is difficult, there should be barriers in shared spaces, staggered start times and one-way walking systems, the guidance says. But where social distancing is seemingly impossible, a sub-group of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) is examining how workers can 'manage' the risk, the Sunday Telegraph reports. Andrew Curran, chief scientific adviser at the Health and Safety Executive said being exposed to someone for 'a few seconds' at a one metre distance could equate to around an hour of being two metres away from the same person. He said: 'If the exposure at a distance of less than two metres is going to be for a short period of time, you manage the risk in the context of duration and orientation. 'There is some physics in this and the Sage sub-group is looking at that to provide better information. 'For example, if you were exposed for a few seconds at one metre, that is about the same as being exposed for a longer period of time - an hour, say - at two metres. It is that order of magnitude. 'There may be elements within a job where there is exposure for a short period, but where the risk is so low it can be managed.'

Hartlepool said in a statement: 'Given that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, Hartlepool Borough Council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday 1st June.

'Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this.'

Liverpool has confirmed that its schools will only be open to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers on June 1.

Asked for his message to councils blocking the return of schools, Mr Gove said children 'only have one chance at education'.

'Over the course of the last decade we have made significant strides in closing the gap between the richest and the poorest in our schools,' he said.

His statements come on the first weekend since lockdown measures were partially lifted, allowing Britons to travel away from their homes to enjoy the outdoors.

Britons woke up bright and early this morning to hit parks and beaches across the country before temperatures soar to 70F in Britain's first Sunday since lockdown restrictions were eased.

While crowds of people were pictured enjoying Dorset's picturesque coastline and Londoners took to the city's green spaces, it appears most are heeding the stark warnings issued by rural country spots this weekend.

In Brighton, Britons were photographed taking a dip in the sea as dozens of others strolled along the clifftop at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne amid climbing temperatures - which are expected to hit 28C on Wednesday.

Several tourist boards have warned that people would be turned away if they became too busy and urged visitors to be careful and respectful of the rules.

Yesterday saw cautious Britons begin to step outside as traffic congestion data across the UK crept up by three per cent. But the predicted stampede of 15million day trippers on the first weekend since lockdown was partially lifted failed to materialise as most decided to enjoy the weather closer to home.

The lower-than-expected numbers could have been down to 'coronaphobia' - the fear of travelling too far during the pandemic.

It is unclear whether Saturday's toe-in-the-water attitude will follow through to today, or whether braver Britons will venture further afield.

The South Downs National Park said people must 'observe the three Rs by exercising restraint, responsibility and respect', and urged people to avoid popular areas and keep 2m away.

The Peak District National Trust said although staff are 'working hard' to welcome back visitors after weeks of restrictions amid the UK's coronavirus crisis, they 'aren't quite ready yet.'

'Like this hare with his ears pricked up, you've probably heard the Peak District has been busy this weekend! We're hopping to it and working hard to welcome you back, but aren't quite ready yet. Our main car parks at Longshaw and Ilam remain closed,' a tweet said.

In Brighton the local council was asking people to stay away from its seafront, with Carmen Appich - chairwoman of Brighton and Hove city council's equalities, communities and culture committee - saying: 'If thousands of people travel to our city on a sunny day and don't or are unable to maintain safe physical distancing because of overcrowding, this increases the risk of a Covid outbreak and puts everyone at risk.'

National Park Authority chief executive Richard Leafe said: 'For now, we're asking people not to rush back to the Lake District - help protect our communities, the fells will still be here when this passes.

'When the time is right, we look forward to welcoming visitors back to the Lake District and have been working with partners to put measures in place that will help keep people safe, such as new car park information and availability to help plan ahead.'

Their advice comes as the weather is set to soar next week with highs in the mid 20s leading to concerns that lockdown-crazy Britons will rush to the outdoors.

The Met Office has forecast highs of 20C today, with temperatures expected to surpass those in Malibu, California on Wednesday when the mercury hits 28C in parts of Britain.

Computer code for Prof Lockdown's model which predicted 500,000 would die from Covid-19 and inspired Britain's 'Stay Home' plan is a 'mess which would get you fired in private industry' say data experts

BY VANESSA CHALMERS HEALTH REPORTER and LUKE MAY FOR MAILONLINE

Scientists have levelled a flurry of criticism against Professor Neil Ferguson's modelling which warned 500,000 people could die from coronavirus and prompted Britain to go into lockdown.

Modelling from Imperial College London epidemiologist Professor Ferguson, who stepped down from the government's Sage group at the start of May, has been described as 'totally unreliable' by other experts.

The coding that produced the sobering death figures was impossible to read, and therefore cast doubts on its strength, The Telegraph reported. It is also some 13 years old, it said.

When other scientists have tried to replicate the findings using the same model, they have repeatedly failed to do.

Prof Ferguson's model is understood to have single-handedly triggered a dramatic change in the Government's handling of the outbreak, as they moved away from herd immunity to a lockdown.

Competing scientists' research - whose models produced vastly different results - has been largely discarded, they claim.

Modelling behind Professor Neil Ferguson's claim that 500,000 Brits could die from Covid-19 has been criticised by scientists

David Richards, co-founder of British data technology company WANdisco said the model was a 'buggy mess that looks more like a bowl of angel hair pasta than a finely tuned piece of programming'.

He said: 'In our commercial reality we would fire anyone for developing code like this and any business that relied on it to produce software for sale would likely go bust.'

WHAT DID PROFESSOR FERGUSON'S WORK SAY? The scientific paper published by Professor Ferguson and his colleagues on the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team was credited for persuading Boris Johnson's Government to ramp up their response to the coronavirus. The paper, released on March 17, and titled Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand, predicted that the Government's original plan to 'mitigate' the outbreak instead of trying to stop it could have led to a quarter of a million people dying. Using data from Italy and China, the scientists predicted how different Government measures would have different impacts on the outbreaks. If no action at all had been taken against the coronavirus it would have claimed 510,000 lives, the team's report said. Had the Government stuck with their strategy of trying to 'mitigate' the spread – allowing it to continue but attempting to slow it down – with limited measures such as home isolation for those with symptoms this number would be roughly halved to 260,000. If the strictest possible measures are introduced, the number of deaths over a two-year period will fall below 20,000, the scientists said. Other points in the Imperial College report, titled Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand, included: Lockdown measures could be brought back if the virus resurfaces after this epidemic is over

The coronavirus outbreak is worse than anything the world has seen since the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic

Dramatic measures to suppress an outbreak carry 'enormous social and economic costs which may themselves have significant impact on health and well-being'

Virus transmission happens evenly – one third of cases are caught in the home, one third at work or school, and one third elsewhere in the community

People are thought to be infectious from 12 hours before symptoms start, or from four days after catching the infection if someone doesn't get symptoms

Patients who do get symptoms are thought to be 50 per cent more infectious than those who don't

People are thought to develop at least short-term immunity after catching the virus, meaning they can't catch it again

Approximately 4.4 per cent of patients need hospital care. 30 per cent of those need intensive care, and 50 per cent of intensive care patients can be expected to die, according to data from China

The average length of a hospital stay for a coronavirus patient is 10 days – eight days for those who recover quickly; 16 days for those who need intensive care

Today marks a week since Boris Johnson addressed the nation and changed England's coronavirus message from Stay Home to Stay Alert, with 34,636 deaths recorded by the Government.

The easing of measures comes almost two months after Britain was placed in lockdown, with government making the decision on, at least in part, the advice of Imperial College London and Prof Ferguson's model outlining the potential harm coronavirus could do to the country.

On March 17, just days before the country was placed into lockdown, Imperial College London published research titled urging a lockdown to be put in place to stop the virus spreading.

Researchers from the university warned 510,000 people could die from the virus if no action was taken.

Had the Government stuck with their strategy of trying to 'mitigate' the spread – allowing it to continue but attempting to slow it down with limited measures such as home isolation for those with symptoms - this number would be roughly halved to 260,000, the report said.

It showed that mitigation would not be insufficient to prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed by looking at bed capacity.

If the strictest possible measures are introduced – including school closures and mandatory home quarantine – the number of deaths over a two-year period will fall below 20,000, the scientists said.

As a result, the Government announced people should stop travelling, stop socialising and work from home.

But critics have today described the coding used by Imperial as 'totally unreliable'.

John Carmack, an American developer who helped refine the code before the paper was published online, said some parts of the code looked like they were machine translated from Fortran', an old coding language.

After growing pressure, the Imperial team released their code, which simulates homes, offices, schools and people movement, and sceptics were quick to point out it was 13 years old.

Furthermore, when analysing the validity of the staggering death estimates, scientists have claimed that it is almost impossible to reproduce the same results from the same data, using the same code as Imperial, The Telegraph reported.

University of Edinburgh researchers reportedly found bugs when running the model, getting different results when they used different machines, or even the same machines in some cases.

The team reported a 'bug' in the system which was fixed - but specialists in the field remain staggered at how inadequate it is.

Four experienced modellers previously noted the code is 'deeply riddled with bugs', has 'huge blocks of code – bad practice' and is 'quite possibly the worst production code I have ever seen'.

Weeks after the model's grim prediction, the University of Edinburgh's Professor Michael Thursfield criticised Professor Ferguson's record as 'patchy'.

He was referring to Professor Ferguson's predictions in the early 2000s that up to 136,000 people could die from mad cow disease.

The Imperial College team’s modelling led to the culling of 6million livestock and was later criticised by epidemiological experts as severely flawed and a tragedy for rural Britain's economy.

Professor Ferguson stepped down from his role on Sage, the board of scientists advising the government through coronavirus pandemic, at the start of the month after it was revealed he had broken lockdown rules he helped to inspire. Antonia Staats (pictured) visited Professor Ferguson at his London flat while Britons were being told to stay home

The team also predicted 200million could die from bird flu and a further 65,000 from swine flu. The final death toll in each case was in the hundreds.

Dr Konstantin Boudnik, the VP of architecture at WANdisco, told The Telegraph: 'The facts from the early 2000s are just yet another confirmation that their modelling approach was flawed to the core.'

Professor Ferguson defended Imperial’s foot and mouth work, saying they were doing 'modelling in real time' with ‘limited data’. He added: 'I think the broad conclusions reached were still valid.'

The true death toll of COVID-19 has far exceeded what was predicted by Imperial under the total lockdown scenario (20,000 over two years).

The Government's total death toll currently stands at 34,466. Using data that collects death certificates, it is more in the region of 39,000.

The Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team came to their predictions with a number of mathematical calculations.

They looked at the most vulnerable people deemed to be 'at the greatest risk of death,' typically elderly people or those with serious underlying health conditions.

The model simulated transport links, population size, healthcare provisions and social networks to predict how the pandemic would spread.

Professor Ferguson and other Imperial College researchers predicted these measures would reduce demand on the healthcare system while protecting those who were most at risk:

Close schools and universities

Anyone with Covid-19 symptoms should isolate at home for seven days

Anyone living with someone who has shown symptoms should quarantine for 14 days.

Social distancing: 'a broad policy that aims to reduce overall contracts that people make outside the household, school or workplace by three-quarters'

Speaking at the time of the paper publication, Professor Ferguson said: 'No country in the world this far has seen an epidemic that large [250,000 deaths], this is an early extrapolation of an early epidemic that was suppressed in China.

'But we have no reason to believe that's not what would happen if we frankly did nothing, and even if we did all we could to slow, not reverse, the spread, we'd still be looking at a very large number of deaths and the health system being overwhelmed.

'Initially when we came up with these kid of estimates they were viewed as what's called the reasonable worst case.

'But as information has been gathered in recent weeks, from particularly Italy but other countries, it has become increasingly clear that actually this is not the reasonable worst case – it is the most likely scenario.'

He added: 'It is likely such measures – most notably, large scale social distancing – will need to be in place for many months, perhaps until a vaccine becomes available.'

While there was overwhelming praise for the research for triggering a much-needed lockdown, criticism of Professor Ferguson's research was voiced at the time.

Professor John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for North West England, accused No 10 of relying on a ‘little clique’ of researchers and failing to consult a wider pool of academics.

‘These guys are being regarded as demigods,’ he said in April.

‘Here we are talking about science but this research is being given a kind of religious status, like tablets of stone from the mountain.’

When the COVID-19 model was made, it used the best data available at the time - from the outbreaks in China and Italy. Information has largely changed since then.

The model uses a string of assumptions, including that 0.9 per cent of those infected will die.

Research in Germany, the US, Sweden and Finland has since estimated the death toll to be much lower - between 0.19 and 0.79 per cent.

Researchers from Australia settled on an overall estimate of 0.75 per cent after collecting information from 13 global studies.

The figure from the University of Wollongong and James Cook University chimes with data emerging from New York, where random antibody testing last month suggested a quarter of the city of eight million people had been infected with the illness, meaning the 16,000 fatalities equaled a death rate of 0.79.

Other assumptions made by the Imperial team included that children are able to spread infection with equivalent efficiency to adults, although little data exists in this area.

Professor Carl Heneghan and Dr Tom Jefferson at the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine questioned the lockdown policy because the virus may already be more widespread than commonly thought.

Modelling by Oxford’s Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group indicates that COVID-19 reached the UK by mid-January at the latest.

The team's research presents a very different view of the epidemic to the modelling at Imperial College London.

It's findings merely a week after Imperial's suggested the coronavirus had already infected far more people in the UK than scientists had previously estimated — perhaps as much as half the population.

The Oxford results would mean the country had already acquired strong herd immunity because COVID-19 had spread for one or two months before a first case was diagnosed.

The herd immunity strategy was abandoned by Government ministers and reversed to a full-scale lockdown due to the model presented by Imperial.

'I am surprised that there has been such unqualified acceptance of the Imperial model,' said Sunetra Gupta, professor of theoretical epidemiology, who led the Oxford study, told the Financial Times.

Since the Oxford study, however, Government-led research has indicated that no-where near half the population have been infected.

Sir Patrick Vallance, Number 10's chief scientific adviser, revealed recently that around four per cent of Britain and 10 per cent of London has developed antibodies against COVID-19.

The estimate - based on data from antibody testing across the home nations carried out a fortnight ago - means only around 2.64million Brits have had the infection.

Meanwhile, the current level of infection is estimated to be about 0.27 per cent.

The findings came from the first round of random public testing of households by the Office for National Statistics. A total of 33 positive cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed out of a sample of 10,705 people.

England's top statisticians estimate that 0.27 per cent of the population has been infected with COVID-19 on any given day over the past fortnight - equal to around 148,000 people and certainly between 94,000 and 222,000

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said at Thursday's Downing Street briefing that the data represented 'really quite a low level of infection' in the community.

Professor Ferguson stepped down from his role on Sage, the board of scientists advising the government through coronavirus pandemic, at the start of the month after it was revealed he had broken lockdown rules he helped to inspire.

It was revealed Professor Ferguson had invited his lover Antonia Staats to his London flat, while the British public was being told to stay home.

A spokesman from the university's Covid-19 response team said: 'The UK government has never relied on a single disease model to inform decision-making.

'As has been repeatedly stated, decision-making around lockdown was based on a consensus view of the scientific evidence, including several modelling studies by different academic groups.

'Multiple groups using different models concluded that the pandemic would overwhelm the NHS and cause unacceptably high mortality in the absence of extreme social distancing measures.

'Within the Imperial research team we use several models of differing levels of complexity, all of which produce consistent results. We are working with a number of legitimate academic groups and technology companies to develop, test and further document the simulation code referred to.

'However, we reject the partisan reviews of a few clearly ideologically motivated commentators.

'Epidemiology is a not a branch of computer science and the conclusions around lockdown rely not on any mathematical model but on the scientific consensus that COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with an infection fatality ratio exceeding 0.5% in the UK.'",15,Low,Right

The staff will play a key role in efforts to prevent a second wave of the deadly disease as they are tasked with figuring out where people who test positive have been and who they may have come into contact with.

Mr Gove's announcement came just days after his fellow Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said the Government had only managed to recruit people for 1,500 of the roles.

However, there are concerns about the long term future of the 'test, track and trace' programme after it was claimed staff are only being hired on initial three month contracts.

Health experts believe such a scheme will need to be in place for as long as 18 months.

Michael Gove today revealed more than 17,000 of 18,000 contact tracer jobs have now been filled

Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced on April 23 that he intended to recruit an army of 18,000 people to work as contact tracers.

Of those, some 15,000 will be tasked with physically identifying and alerting people who may have been exposed to the virus, so they can protect themselves and others around them by self-isolating.

The remaining 3,000 will be Public Health England experts who will focus on stopping outbreaks in critical settings like care homes and hospitals.

Mr Gove was asked this morning on Sky News how many of the roles have now been filled and he replied: ‘Just over 17,000.’

Asked if the Government will have 18,000 by next week, the Minister for the Cabinet Office said: ‘Yes. Here I have to praise the work of the Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

‘In the past people have seen Matt and the Government set ambitious targets and they have said “oh, the target on testing, that won’t be met” - Matt met that target.

‘It is now the case as I say that more than 17,000 people have been recruited for contact tracing so we are on course to meet that target again.

‘It is more evidence that we have in Matt an energetic and determined Health Secretary who is throwing everything into the fight against the virus and making sure that we mobilise a united, national effort.’

Mr Gove said the programme will be up and running 'by the end of this month'.

The contact tracing initiative will be used to try to minimise the spread of the disease in the future by identifying people who are sick and removing them from the community until they have recovered.

Experts have suggested the scheme will be needed for up to 18 months but The Sunday Telegraph today reported that people are only being hired for an initial three month period.

Adverts for the roles state they are for a 'minimum of 12 weeks' or an 'initial 10-12 weeks.

Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: 'Contact tracing is a vital part of the test, trace and isolate infrastructure that must be in place for lockdown restrictions to be eased.

'This has to be a long-term role and led by local expertise in public health services and primary care.

'These adverts suggest ministers don't understand the scale of what is needed.'

Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, said last week that just 1,500 roles had been filled

Northern Ireland Secretary Mr Lewis said on May 15 that while there had been 'about 15,000' applications for the contact tracer roles only 1,500 staff had been hired.

Mr Lewis told Sky News: 'I don't think we've got to 18,000 [contact tracers] just yet. I think there's about 15,000 applications... we're looking to, as you say, get up to 18,000.'

Pushed again on how many of the 15,000 applicants have actually been given a job, he added: 'As of this morning, I'm not sure of exactly how many of the 15,000 have been hired. Earlier in the week, it was about 1,500. It would have gone up since then.'

The contact tracers are set to be deployed at the same time as the NHSX mobile app which is currently being trialled on residents on the Isle of Wight ahead of a national roll out.

It uses bluetooth to detect when two phones have been near each other for a sustained period of time.

When someone develops symptoms of Covid-19, they notify the app which then uses the Bluetooth log to inform other users that they may also have the virus and need to be checked.",15,Low,Right

Britain today recorded another 468 coronavirus deaths on the first Saturday since the draconian lockdown was eased, taking the UK's official fatality toll to 34,466.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson revealed the figures, which are up by 30 per cent from last Saturday's 346, at tonight's Downing Street press briefing.

Last Saturday's lower count may have been the result of reporting delays over the bank holiday Friday on May 8. But it is a worrying sign that deaths have risen nonetheless.

Mr Williamson defended the Government's controversial decision to reopen schools in England next month after ministers faced fierce backlash from teaching unions and anxious parents who fear the outbreak will spiral out of control again if staff are not given sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and schools are not able to enforce social distancing.

Mr Williamson said it was crucial that pupils returned to education so that the poorest children in society do not fall further behind, adding: 'They will be the ones who will miss out on the opportunities. There are children from difficult or very unhappy homes for whom school is the happiest moment in their week and it's also the safest place for them to be.'

The education secretary promised it would be a 'cautious, phased return', with smaller class sizes of no more than 15 and stringent cleaning protocols in place. The plan is for children in nursery and pre-school, Reception and Years 1 and 6 to go back on June 1. Pupils in Years 10 and 12 will be allowed to return on a limited basis, he said.

The Government does not provide a breakdown of how many deaths occurred in different settings, such as hospitals or care homes, but at least 181 of today's fatalities definitely occurred in hospitals because NHS England reveals new deaths recorded by trusts every afternoon.

Scotland (41), Wales (18) and Northern Ireland (four) do add care home deaths to their daily updates - but the nations do not provide a clear breakdown of how many fatalities occurred in each setting.

It comes amid reports Public Health England could be axed after widespread criticism of its testing strategy, which has lagged behind the majority of countries in Europe.

More than 240,500 people have been officially diagnosed with the viral disease but the true scale of Britain's outbreak is considerably larger because of a controversial decision to abandon a widespread swabbing regime early on in the crisis.

Government officials suggesting up to 6.6million are likely to have caught it in England alone. Prime Minister Boris Johnson informed a meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives that he was planning a review of 'a number of institutions' once coronavirus is beaten back.

The University of Nottingham has suggested that coronavirus cases fell dramatically after the sunniest April on record, with strong UV light killing the virus and vitamin D strengthening the immune system.

Mr William also expressed sympathy to students affected by the outbreak during the Downing Street briefing, saying: 'At this time of year, GCSE and A-Level students would have been making final preparations for their exams while other students would have been enjoying their summer term.

'If you're one of them, as I've said before, I can only say how sorry I am that this has all happened to you this year. The sacrifices that you have had to make through no choice of your own. But the impact that this coronavirus has had on your life has made things so incredibly tough for all of you.'

'They stand to lose more by staying away from school,' he said. He praised teachers for 'going above and beyond the call of duty' for continuing to teach children of key workers, as well as making sure resources were available at home for children at home.

'You have simply been outstanding and we are so grateful for what you've done,' he said. 'We have been quite clear all along that we'd only start inviting more children when our five key tests have been met. That position has not changed nor will it.'

But he added: 'We can now start the planning for very limited return to school for some pupils potentially as early as next month. There is a consequence to this, the longer that schools are closed the more that children miss out.

'Teachers know that there are children out there that have not spoken or played with another child their own age for the last two months. They know there are children from difficult or very unhappy homes for whom school is the happiest moment in their week, and it's also the safest place for them to be.'

Together these measures will create an inherently safer system where the risk of transmission is substantially reduced for children, their teachers and also their families.'

Mr Williamson added that full and detailed guidance had been issued after working closely with people in the sector. He continued: 'It goes without saying that we will be carefully monitoring the impact of this first phase.'

He said the return was in line with other European countries in terms of getting schools, colleges and nurseries back. 'I know lots of you will be worried about sending your children to school. Every one of us wants the very best for our children and I know how stressful this time has been for families across the country.

'I want to reassure you that this approach is based on the best scientific advice, with children at the very heart of everything we do.

'Education is one of the most important and precious gifts that we can give any child.' Mr Williamson said 'it is thanks to their teachers and the support of their teachers that they are safe and happy'. He said that children who do not have support at home 'will be the ones who fall furthest behind.'

It came after bosses behind dozens of primary schools in England backed plans for pupils to return to classrooms, despite strong opposition from teaching unions.

The heads of four academy chains - Reach 2, Harris, Oasis and GEP - which teach a quarter of the UK's children, have all thrown their weight behind government proposals to reopen schools by June 1, according to The Times.

It comes amid warnings from unions that doing so would put both teachers and students at risk of contracting coronavirus. Many parents remain divided on whether to send their children back while the pandemic is still very much raging.

School governer Sadie-Marie Murray says she won't be letting her boys Samson, 9, Charlie, 7, and Elias, 4 return to school until she had '100 per cent assurance that schools can maintain the social distancing measures required to keep my children safe'

Jennifer Bailey, 42, who is CEO of Carla shoes, wants to keep her two daughters, who have five and seven, in education without disruption and is looking forward to the girls going back to school

Sir Steve Lancashire, chief executive of Reach 2, the country's biggest primary multi-academy trust (MAT) with 50 schools, told the newspaper: 'Our intention is to open all of our schools for the priority year groups, and will do so as long as the rigorous risk assessments we carry out for each school gives us the reassurance we need that we can keep our pupils and staff as safe as possible.'

MAT schools work independently from local authorities and are able to set their own rules and regulations. They also cater to some of the country's most disadvantaged children, who could suffer if attempts are made to stop a return, Oasis Charitable Trust's founder said.

Steve Chalke called the opposition 'rather middle class' and said it could pose great risk to children 'stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise and little or no nutritious food.'

However, Hartlepool in County Durham, has now joined Liverpool in saying it would ignore the plan to let some primary school pupils back.

The largest doctor's union also backed the teachers' representatives today, saying they are 'absolutely right' to argue it is unsafe for schools to open next month.

In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon said yesterday SNP ministers would not take a 'cavalier' approach to reopening, adding that pupils will not fully be back in classes until at least August.

Boris Johnson ordered the closure of schools on March 18, just days before the national lockdown was introduced, with many remaining open to look after vulnerable children and those of frontline key workers.

Under new government plans to ease the country out of lockdown, children in reception, Year 1 and Year 6 could start back on June 1 with smaller class sizes, of no more than 15, with procedures in place to limit the spread of the virus.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson this week demanded teachers union do their 'duty' and stop their blanket objections to the proposed phased return.

In response Britain's second-largest teaching union, NASUWT, threatened to sue school chiefs if they put teachers 'at risk'.

The union, which has 310,000 members, wrote to headteachers, academy bosses and local authorities to outline their stance.

In the letter the union said: 'No teacher should be expected to go into a school that is not safe and until it can be demonstrated that it is safe to do so we will be continuing to support and advise members on that basis.'

Meanwhile, Public Health England could be axed after widespread criticism of its rolling on the UK's testing fiasco, Boris Johnson told Tory MPs last night.

The Prime Minister informed a meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives that he was planning a review of 'a number of institutions' once coronavirus is beaten back, according to the Times.

Tory MPs are furious at what they see as PHE's hampering of efforts to develop viable antibody tests that could potentially allow people who have had the virus to return to work and life to return to something approaching normal.

In the virtual meeting last night Mr Johnson also warned he will not freeze NHS pay or return to austerity to get Britain out of the economic black hole caused by coronavirus.

The Prime Minister insisted his plans to revitalise left-behind parts of the UK would go ahead to stimulate economic growth amid signs that the UK is already in a pandemic-induced recession.

Mr Johnson was asked whether austerity would be part of the response but said quite the opposite: in fact he would spend more on infrastructure projects and the Northern Powerhourse.

He spoke a lot about the government we must address the concerns of the poor, saying it was important to look after them.

Asked whether nurses could expect a pay freeze as part of any recovery plan the PM, who spent a week in intensive care being treated for coronavirus, said 'absolutely not. Anyone who suggests that can sit on it', according to the Telegraph.

The PM said this was a completely different Tory government to anything known before, pointing out that many working class people had entrusted them with their vote.

He laid out his 'grandmother's footsteps' plan to end the lockdown as he vowed to accelerate his domestic agenda in the wake of the virus.

Former Brexit secretary David Davis backed the approach this morning, tweeting: 'Pleased to hear Boris Johnson dismiss austerity as a way to pay off the deficit after the crisis.

Asked whether nurses could expect a pay freeze as part of any recovery plan, Mr Johnson (seen with Carrie Symonds at the Clap for Carers on Thursday) said 'absolutely not'

'To attempt it would be economic nonsense. It should be paid off over 50 years, along with some limited QE (quantitative easing).'

In the virtual meeting with Tory MPs, the Prime Minister said he would speed up his plans to reform hospitals, schools and the police.

He told them his aim was to 'build a platform' for this country to recover from the 'once-in-a-generation shock and repay the trust of those who put us here'. And he vowed not to bring back austerity.

Mr Johnson also explained that he wanted to ease the lockdown in such a gradual way that it would not provoke a second wave of the disease.

This is similar to the playground game of 'grandmother's footsteps', in which children have to creep up on the grandmother to avoid provoking her.

The PM said the government had to be very careful when dealing with this virus, saying it was a question of driving forward very cautiously.

But he said he wanted to come out of the lockdown as quickly as possible.

The PM spoke to about 150 of his MPs, although many complained they could not hear him because so few participants had 'muted' their computers.

Mr Johnson talked about not letting the crisis define the UK, and not to let it get in the way of the country's ambitions.

He vowed to push ahead on the domestic agenda on hospitals and police, and said he would go faster on building better infrastructure and education.

Mr Johnson also defended his government's record on testing, saying the UK was testing more people per head of population than any other country bar two.

Meanwhile, police have been stopping day-trippers heading to Brighton today despite changes to government rules as an estimated 15 million leisure trips are expected to be made this weekend.

The British public has been warned by authorities in Brighton and Hove, Whitby, and Scarborough this week not to flock to beauty spots and has been told roads would close if they became too busy.

Seaside towns and national parks are worried about the risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections as city dwellers descend upon parks and beaches on the first weekend since lockdown was eased.

The Peak District National Park said that the Langsett area at the north-eastern edge of the park was 'extremely busy' on Saturday morning, making social distancing difficult.

Visitors seemingly flocked to the area despite people being asked to 'think carefully' before visiting national parks and beaches. On Twitter, park bosses in the Peak District said: 'This area (Langsett) is reported to be extremely busy with car parks currently full and social distancing difficult.

'Please don't travel to the area or park outside of designated bays.'

Police officers are stopping cars and asking people where they are going, despite clear government guidance explaining that people can head out on extended day trips.

Live tracking data indicates that there were more cars on the roads at 1pm today than at the same time last Saturday, as 15 million leisure trips are expected to be made this weekend.",15,Low,Right

The clots, also known as thrombosis, can become fatal if they migrate to major organs in the body and cut off their blood supply.

The blockages can trigger heart attacks, strokes, organ failure and the fatal lung condition pulmonary embolism.

Severe inflammation - an overreaction by the immune system to COVID-19 infection - is thought to be the cause of the blood clots.

Roopen Arya, a professor of thrombosis at King's College London, said that while pneumonia was still the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients, doctors were now becoming 'more and more aware' of the problem.

One in three patients who fall severely ill with coronavirus develop dangerous blood clots that may be contributing to their deaths

He told the Radio 4 Today programme this morning: 'With a huge outpouring of data over the past few weeks I think it has become apparent that thrombosis is a major problem.

'Particularly in severely affected Covid patients in critical care, where some of the more recent studies show that nearly half the patients have pulmonary embolism or blood clot on the lungs.'

Clots that start in the lower body can migrate to the lungs, causing a deadly blockage called a pulmonary embolism - a common killer of COVID-19 patients.

Blockages near the heart can lead to a heart attack, another common cause of death in infected people. And clots above the chest can cause strokes.

Roopen Arya, a professor of thrombosis at King's College London, said that while pneumonia was still the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients, doctors were now becoming 'more and more aware' of the problem

Scientists aren't sure why the virus causes clots - but they believe it could be the result of a an immune overreaction called a 'cytokine storm'.

Cytokines are chemical-signaling molecules which guide a healthy immune response. They tell immune cells to attack viral molecules in the body.

But in some patients, this process goes into overdrive and immune cells begin destroying healthy tissues.

This can lead to damaged blood vessels which leak and cause blood pressure to plummet, driving up the chance of clots forming, according to Dr Jamie Garfield from Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia.

Other scientists say the clots be a byproduct of the way COVID-19 invades the human body.

Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline: 'Covid binds to an enzyme called ACE2 which is on the surface of the cell. It simply uses it as a way of attaching itself but in doing so the enzyme function of ACE2 is reduced.

'The consequence of this is an imbalance of hormones called Angiotensin I and Angiotensin II which together regulate blood pressure. It could be related to the increase in strokes reported.'

Dr Robert Bonow, a professor of cardiology at Northwestern University, said it may be the coronavirus' unique shape that is causing the blood clotting issues.

WHAT'S CAUSING THE CLOTS? While experts are unsure why the virus causes the blockages, there are three main theories: CYTOKINE STORM The prevailing theory is that it is the result of a an immune overreaction called a 'cytokine storm'. Cytokines are chemical-signaling molecules which guide a healthy immune response. They tell immune cells to attack viral molecules in the body. But in some people, this resonpse goes into overdrive and immune cells start attacking healthy tissue as well, known as a cytokine storm. As blood vessels become damaged they can leak, causing blood pressure to drop and driving up the chance of clots forming. BYPRODUCT OF INFECTION Other scientists say the surge in strokes may be a byproduct of the way COVID-19 invades the human body. Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline: 'Covid binds to an enzyme called ACE2 which is on the surface of the cell. 'It simply uses it as a way of attaching itself but in doing so the enzyme function of ACE2 is reduced. 'The consequence of this is an imbalance of hormones called Angiotensin I and Angiotensin II which together regulate blood pressure. 'It could be related to the increase in strokes reported.' VIRUS' UNIQUE SHAPE Dr Robert Bonow, a professor of cardiology at Northwestern University, said it may be the coronavirus' unique shape that is causing the bloodclotting issues. He said the virus' spikes, which latch onto receptors in cells, can also attach to blood vessels. Once they dock onto these blood vessel cells, the viral particles can trigger damage to these as well as to heart muscle, Dr Bonow says. Advertisement

He told MailOnline: 'With COVID specifically, what you see that you don't with the flu, is because under a microscope, coronavirus has all these spikes coming out of it, and those spikes are little proteins that are looking for receptors on the cells that they attach onto,'

'It's specifically looking for receptors in the lungs, but those same receptors sit on blood vessels, so it can attach on the lungs but also on blood vessels.'

Once they dock onto these blood vessel cells, the viral particles can trigger damage to these as well as to heart muscle, Dr Bonow says.

They can trigger 'hypercoagual states,' causing blood clots that lead to heart attacks.

If COVID-19 targets blood vessels, it could explain why people who already have damaged vessels - such as diabetes and high blood pressure patients - are more likely to fall critically ill.

Exactly how the virus attacks the blood vessels remains a mystery, but several scientific paper and pre-prints have shown the deadly side effect is common.

Heart damage was discovered in 20 per cent of patients hospitalised in Wuhan according to a March 25 paper in JAMA Cardiology.

Another study in the outbreak's epicentre found 44 per cent of those in ICU suffered heart arrhythmias.

Thirty-eight per cent of Dutch ICU patients had blood clotting in a April 10 study published in Thrombosis Research.

Between 20 and 40 percent of COVID-19 patients at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, have developed blood clots - even after being put on anticoagulants.

It comes after a study by University College London found coronavirus caused an increased risk of blood clots and blockages in the brain.

The small study focused on six patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had suffered a stroke caused by the sudden loss of blood circulation to the brain.

The team, that included neurologists from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, saw an increase in D-dimer - a blood protein linked to clotting.

The authors say the exaggerated inflammatory immune response known to occur in COVID-19 patients stimulates abnormal blood clotting in the brain.

They say there was evidence of raised D-dimer in the blood - that is a production of antibodies created from an abnormal immune system response.

Corresponding author, Professor David Werring and colleagues looked at six patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to blockage of a large brain artery.

Acute ischaemic stroke is caused by the sudden loss of blood circulation to an area of the brain, resulting in loss of neurological function.

The findings suggest early testing for D-dimer in COVID-19 patients, could enable clinicians to prescribe specific treatments at a much earlier stage.

They say this might reduce the number of people subsequently having further strokes or blood clots elsewhere in the body.",15,Low,Right

And if it was, might you have locked down your life for nothing? The answer lies in a simple test that looks for antibodies in the blood – proteins released by the immune system in response to the Covid-19 virus.

The theory is that if you’ve developed antibodies, the immune system is primed to fight the virus, and it’s highly unlikely you’ll get it again.

Such a test doesn’t tell you if you currently have it – a different test is used to diagnose active disease. But it will tell you if you’ve had it in the past.

Miranda Levy, pictured at her father's home in Chigwell, Essex, was one of the first people in the UK to receive the new state-of-the-art ELISA test for Covid-19 antibodies. Ms Levy was convinced she and her boyfriend Hugo picked up the virus while in New York in January. Her boyfriend, who lives in New York was positive, but Ms Levy was negative

And this has been deemed crucial from the very start of the pandemic – the key to establishing exactly how many have been infected.

The reason? Up to 80 per cent of those who get Covid-19 suffer a mild illness or may not even realise they’ve had it – and diagnostic testing has, until recently, been limited to those ill enough to end up in hospital.

Just how prevalent Covid-19 really has been is still unknown. Last week, Public Health England backed a new antibody blood test developed by Swiss firm Roche, which officials hope might finally provide an answer. The manufacturers claim the test is almost 100 per cent accurate – and are in talks with NHS providers about distributing it across the country.

But scientists are cautious. Previous attempts to roll out such tests have proved disastrous. The initial misfire came in early April, when 3.5 million antibody test kits ordered for use by the Government were found to be useless. Studies showed that the tests were unable to differentiate between antibodies triggered by Covid-19 and those associated with the common cold.

A few weeks later, officials announced plans to distribute pregnancy-test style finger-prick tests to millions before some of those were found to be ‘insufficiently accurate’.

But at the same time, scores of private companies have begun offering similar DIY tests, costing up to £100. Some of the country’s biggest employers have even batch-bought the devices and are testing staff to get them back to work quickly and safely.

So do any of them work?

Clinics in the UK are offering Covid-19 antibody tests which cost £300 and requires blood to be taken in a GP surgery or by a specialist clinic with the samples examined in a laboratory

Broadly speaking, there are two different types of antibody tests. The failed tests initially planned for use by the Government were so-called lateral flow immunoassay (LFI). They can be completed within minutes at home and look a bit like pregnancy kits.

The test must be taken about at least ten days after symptoms emerge, to allow time for antibodies to be produced.

Using a tiny needle, you prick your finger to draw blood, then place a droplet on a piece of blotting paper.

Built into the blotting paper are proteins called antigens. These antigens are targeted by antibodies released by the immune system deployed to fight the virus.

If antibodies are present in blood, they will bind to the antigens on the paper. A chemical is triggered, causing a blue line to emerge – an indicator of a positive result. Results are seen within ten minutes.

Yet several studies have found these tests to be unreliable – and for this reason, experts urge extreme caution.

‘A large quantity of antibodies needs to be produced by the body in order for these tests to detect them,’ says Dr Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London.

The antibody tests are different to the techniques used to determine whether someone is currently infected with Covid-19 which ordinarily uses an oral and nasal swab

The concentration of antibodies found in the blood of those who have had Covid-19 is thought to vary – those who have had the worst symptoms have been found to have the highest numbers. However, those who have not had the disease as severely may have lower concentrations, and the LFI test may not pick these up.

‘These tests have a high false negative rate,’ warns Dr Ward.

Will Irving, professor of microbiology and infectious diseases at Nottingham University, adds: ‘In laboratories, we can add chemicals that help to pick up minuscule amounts of antibodies. You simply can’t do that with these tests.’

The second, more robust, method is a blood test carried out in clinics, which is considered the ‘gold standard’. Called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, it involves taking about 10ml of blood, which is then spun in a machine to extract the antibody-rich blood serum. The serum is then placed on to plastic plates coated with specific coronavirus antigens. This too measures the number of antibodies that attach themselves to the antigens on the plate.

Unlike the LFI tests, only the blood serum – which carries the antibodies – is used, making it far easier to detect them.

The new antibody test approved for use last week, called the Elecsys, is a type of ELISA test. Blood samples taken at a GP surgery or specialist clinic are then analysed in a laboratory by scientists.

But what would a positive result actually mean?

The answer is not as straightforward as it might seem.

One UK clinic, Private Harley Street Clinic in London, is already offering its version of an ELISA blood test for a hefty price of £300.

Journalist Miranda Levy, 52, was one of the first Britons to take it. She was convinced that the rampant fever, persistent headaches and scratchy throat that plagued her in January, was, in fact, the coronavirus. ‘My boyfriend Hugo and I first became unwell during a holiday to the US,’ says Miranda, from Essex.

‘We flew to and from Nicaragua via New York, which must have been swarming with the virus at the time. My cough had finished by the time I got home a week later, but I didn’t feel right for weeks.

I'm relieved to have some immunity Daniel Imperiale says the £300 he spent on an antibody test was worth it for the ‘sense of security’. ‘Knowing that I definitely had the virus, so have some immunity to it, has stopped me feeling anxious when venturing out the house,’ says the 32-year-old who lives in West London. ‘When the time comes to get on the Tube and go back to work, I won’t feel as nervous because now I probably have protection against it.’ Marketing manager Daniel Imperiale says the £300 he spent on an antibody test was worth it for the ‘sense of security’ after the Harley Street test confirmed he had previously been infected by Covid-19 The marketing manager visited The Private Harley Street Clinic in London two weeks ago for the blood test, nearly two months after recovering from suspected Covid-19. ‘I rarely get ill, so when I woke up with a fever of 39 degrees – and it didn’t shift for five days – I just knew I’d got it,’ he says. ‘I’d moved to London from New York in February, and I’d spent two weeks sightseeing in central London, mixing closely with lots of tourists, so it was unsurprising that I’d caught it. ‘I checked the Government website and saw I had all the symptoms on the checklist.’ Thankfully, his illness passed after five days of bed rest but he was never officially diagnosed. When he read about the private antibody test that might tell him for sure, he signed up immediately. Two weeks ago, he went for an hour-long appointment, in which the nurse took a sample of blood, and a week later the results arrived by email. ‘I’d tested positive and had antibodies, which meant I had some level of immunity,’ says Daniel. ‘I felt an immediate sense of relief. But I am sensible and I know that there’s no guarantees. ‘I’m still keeping my two-metre distance and hand-washing.’ Advertisement

‘We didn’t think much of it until Covid-19 hit the headlines in March – and my boyfriend, who lives in America, was offered a free ELISA test as part of a research programme. It came back positive.’

When Miranda found a clinic offering the same test in the UK, she signed up immediately. But her results, which arrived last week, were negative.

‘I just thought, “How could that be?” Hugo had had a slight fever in March – so mild, he hadn’t even mentioned it. Perhaps that was Covid-19? I was so disappointed – I wanted to feel like I had virus-fighting superpowers too. But then I read articles suggesting a positive result may not mean a person is immune after all.’

Miranda’s doubts are justified. First of all, not all ELISA tests are created equally.

‘The technology works but each individual test varies in terms of accuracy,’ says Dr Ward. ‘There is currently no legislation that requires manufacturers to provide evidence to show their particular device works.

‘The test may have only been verified using animals or in petri dishes – not on humans.’

The same doubts apply to the new test backed by Public Health England – there is little detail about the research on which the accuracy claims are based.

‘Without seeing the study methods and the data, it’s impossible to verify these claims of accuracy,’ warns Prof Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University.

And Prof Irving adds: ‘Manufacturers might say their test is 99 per cent sensitive, based on 100 people with Covid-19.

‘But if all 100 of those people were very ill in hospital – producing large numbers of antibodies – then we’ve no idea if it will find antibodies in non-hospitalised patients with a mild illness who produce far less.’

A major trial run by Imperial Healthcare Trust in London and the Department for Health hopes to fill this gap in information, by randomly distributing 100,000 of the newly approved antibody tests to people in the community.

But even if the test is 100 per cent accurate, what does it actually tell you?

‘For now, antibody tests can only tell you if you’ve had the virus, not if you’re definitely protected from reinfection,’ says Dr Ward. ‘We currently don’t know the level of antibody needed to grant immunity.’

Promisingly, studies from China suggest high levels of Covid-19 specific antibodies do appear to indicate immunity, or at least a less severe second infection. But how long immunity lasts is unknown, according to studies of previous coronaviruses. Survivors of SARS had protective antibodies for anything between three and 17 years, and they seemed to prevent reinfection. But a 2016 follow-up of MERS patients showed their protective antibodies lasted just three years.

Unlike the flu virus, which mutates and so can evade existing antibodies, mutations in the new coronavirus are rare.

But, as Dr Ward says, antibodies are only one small part of the puzzle when it comes to understanding Covid-19 immunity. ‘The immune system draws on several important modes of defence to guard us against reinfection,’ she says. Scientists are also investigating the role of a type of fighter cell, released in response to a virus, called a T-cell. Studies show these can remain for longer than antibodies – in recovered SARS patients they’ve been detected more than a decade later.

‘There’s a lot of research to do before we know what is needed to make someone immune from Covid-19,’ says Dr Ward.

‘It’s going to take years of studying people, the further away they get from the first infection.’

So, if there is no guarantee antibodies grant us immunity, why is the Government testing for them?

Many people are afraid they may contract Covid-19 while commuting to work where social distancing is difficult

‘Antibody testing is crucial for understanding the spread of the disease and how deadly it is,’ says Dr Ward. ‘It may be that thousands of people in the community have come into contact with it but haven’t had symptoms. If this is the case, it would dramatically reduce the mortality rate.

‘We saw this in swine flu – only after subsequent antibody tests did we learn that, in many people, it was so harmless they didn’t even know they had it. It could be that we’re massively overestimating the mortality rate.’",15,Low,Right

Analysis by Public Health England and Cambridge University calculated the crucial reproduction rate, known as the R, peaked at 3 in the capital in late February.

But the R - the average number of people each COVID-19 patient infects - plummeted to 2.3 in the days before March 23, when the UK shut down and the economy was crippled.

It suggests that COVID-19's ability to spread was already severely hampered by simple social distancing and home working measures introduced a week earlier.

Epidemiologists tell MailOnline more white collar jobs in London meant more employees were able to abide by the work from home rules and isolate from others, making it easier to shut the virus out of the capital.

The analysis also suggests the R in London tumbled below 1 just days after lockdown, when the number of new cases began halving every three-and-a-half days.

London's reproduction rate is now just 0.4, with fewer than 24 people becoming infected every day. If cases continue to decrease at the current rate the virus will be virtually eradicated in the capital by June.

The team's model says only one death occurs in every 160 cases. This suggests, at the current rate, London's daily death toll will drop to a consistent level of zero in three weeks, which is the average time lag between someone being diagnosed, their condition becoming deadly and their death being recorded.

London's crisis is in stark contrast to the rest of the UK, where the R is closer to 1 - the dangerous level at which the disease could spiral out of control again. MPs said last night the data highlights the need to ease lockdown on a region by region basis.

London's R - the average number of people each COVID-19 patient infects - fell from 3 to 2.3 in before lockdown on March 23, most likely because of simple social distancing and home working measures. Deaths hit their peak in April before plummeting by May

London's reproduction rate is now just 0.4, with fewer than 24 people becoming infected every day. If cases continue to decrease at the current rate the virus will be virtually eradicated in the capital by June

The cumulative number of cases has barely changed in London since the start of April, according to the projection by the Cambridge-PHE team which suggests almost 2million people have had the infection in the capital

Number of new daily cases: The team also estimated that London has recorded fewer than 1,000 new cases a day since April 19, and said the number of new cases by May 10 was likely to be no higher than 24

On March 23, 213,000 people were contracting coronavirus every day in London, the PHE and Cambridge modelling suggests.

That plummeted as soon as restrictions were brought in, falling to below 10,000 by April 7 and dropping to less than 24 this week.

But in the North East and Yorkshire, where the R is 0.8, double the level in London, there are still 4,000 daily infections.

Bim Afolami, the Tory MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, in Hertfordshire, said the Government should consider easing lockdown in London before the rest of the UK.

He told The Telegraph: 'If you look at other countries, they've often adopted regional approaches. If it makes sense from a health perspective, we need to consider it.'

Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers said: 'These figures are good news. They show lockdown measures have been working and I think they make the case for further easing of the lockdown in London.

The coronavirus is infecting people twice as fast in the North East of England than it is in London, real-time tracking of the reproductive 'R' rating shows

WHAT IS THE R NUMBER? Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought' - or simply R. It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect if the virus is reproducing in its ideal conditions. Most epidemiologists - scientists who track disease outbreaks - believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has an R value of around 3. But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark. As an outbreak goes on, the R0 may be referred to more accurately as Re or just R, as other factors come into play to influence how well it is able to spread. Estimates of the COVID-19 R vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment. As an outbreak progress the R may simply be referred to as R, which means the effective rate of infection - the nought works on the premise that nobody in the population is protected, which becomes outdated as more people recover.

They estimate that 1.8million people in London (20 per cent) have already had the disease.

And they say between 10 and 53 people in the capital caught the virus on May 10. Their forecast also predicts that that number would have dropped to just 10 by today.

The data also suggested COVID-19 kills around 0.63 per cent of people it infects - a similar figure that has been quoted around the world, which would make it around six times deadlier than seasonal flu. But they admitted it could be as low as 0.49 or as high as 0.81 per cent.

But the Cambridge-PHE study showed a huge variation between different age groups, warning the virus has an infection-fatality rate of around 16 per cent of over-75s but saying it was below 0.018 per cent for anyone under the age of 44 - the equivalent of one death for every 10,000 cases.

For people between the ages of 45 and 64, the team said the death rate was around 0.28 per cent. While the rate was in the region of 1.8 per cent for people aged between 65 and 74.

The data also broke down the 'attack rate' - the number of people infected in total - for each of the regions in England, saying that around 12 per cent of England had caught the virus in total.

They say London has been the hardest-hit region, with around 20 per cent of the capital having caught the disease since Britain's outbreak began to spiral out of control, followed by the North West (14 per cent).

In the Midlands and the North East and Yorkshire, the rate is estimated to be 11 per cent. While the team say around one in ten people in the East of England have already had COVID-19. The rate is just 8 per cent in the South East and even lower (5 per cent) in the South West.

The real-time tracking of the R rate is the latest piece of evidence that northern towns are now bearing the brunt of the crisis after the virus was shut out of the capital.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted that keeping the R below 1 is the most important of five tests that must be passed before returning to normal life.

The R is used to measure how fast the disease is spreading, and if it rises above 1, cases would start to grow rapidly and the virus could spiral out of control.

The latest research suggests the R is below 1 in all corners of England, but there is variation between regions.

In the Midlands, the value is believed to be 0.68, but in the South West it is thought to be around 0.76.

The PHE and Cambridge researchers say the R is 0.71 in the East of England, 0.73 in the North West and 0.71 in the South East.

The scientists drew from data from death certificates, as well as NHS and PHE coronavirus test results to predict the reproduction number.

It comes after it was revealed that eight out of 10 of areas with the highest infection rates in Britain are in northern parts of England.

That gives the small industrial town of 67,000 people, tucked away on the on the Furness peninsula in the North West, a rate of 882 cases per 100,000

WHICH AREAS HAVE THE HIGHEST COVID-19 INFECTION RATES PER 100,000 PEOPLE? Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria ( 822) Lancaster, Lancashire (522) South Lakeland, Cumbria (488) Ashford, Kent (484) Gateshead, Tyne and Wear (478) Sunderland (478) South Tyneside, Tyne and Wear (448) Middlesbrough (447) Carlisle (431) Brent, London (429) ...AND WHICH AREAS HAVE THE LOWEST COVID-19 INFECTION RATES PER 100,000 PEOPLE? Hastings, East Sussex (47) Mendip, Somerset (50) Torridge, North Devon (51) Rutland, East Midlands (68) West Lindsey, Lincolnshire (80) North Devon (87) North East Lincolnshire (89) Rother, East Sussex (90) South Hams, Devon (91) Arun, West Sussex (91)

The small industrial town of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, has an infection rate of 882 cases per 100,000 - almost double that in Brent (419), the worst-hit part of London.

At least 552 people in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, have caught COVID-19 since the outbreak began in February, according to the latest Government data.

That gives the small industrial town of 67,000 people, tucked away on the Furness peninsula in the North West, a rate of 882 cases per 100,000 - or 0.88 per cent.

To put this into perspective, Barrow's infection rate is more than double that of Wales (365), triple England's (244) and Scotland's (251) and quadruple the rate recorded in Northern Ireland (220).

Figures show that Cumbria is also home to the area with the third highest infection rate. South Lakeland - east of Barrow-in-Furness - has a rate of 488 cases per 100,000 people.

And the town with the second-highest rate is Lancaster (753), which is located on the other side of Morecambe Bay in Lancashire.

Experts are puzzled as to why this part of the North West has turned into a hotspot for COVID-19 but local public health officials say it may be skewed by higher testing figures.

The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trust (UHMBT) covers three hospitals treating coronavirus patients - the Furness general in Barrow, the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and the Westmorland general in Kendal in South Lakeland. The trust has recorded 156 deaths, according to NHS England statistics.

Colin Cox, the director of public health for Cumbria, claims the NHS trust began mass-testing its employees and patients at the end of February and has conducted 'three times' more swabs on average, which 'may explain a fair chunk of it'.

A total 61 people in Barrow have fallen victim to coronavirus, giving it a death rate of 91 for every 100,000 – one of the worst outside of London.

Officials are stumped as to why the town has been plagued with so many cases, despite welcoming just a fraction of the tourists compared to the nearby Lake District.

Lee Roberts, deputy leader of Barrow borough council, said the figures were a 'big worry' given that lockdown measures are being relaxed today.

Some of the cases can be traced back to a 'super-spreader' house party before lockdown in March, where at least six people had the virus.

The first person to die from the illness in the town had been at the party, according to The Guardian. But how the disease managed to race around the town and infect hundreds more remains a mystery.

Mr Roberts believes high levels of deprivation are partly to blame for the high infection rate.

An Office for National Statistics (ONS) report this month revealed that people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying at twice the rate of those in the wealthiest regions.

Experts say this is because they are exposed to the virus more because they are more likely to work in jobs that cannot be done from home, live in overcrowded homes and use public transport more.

The poorest in society are also more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions and have compromised immune systems - putting them at an increased risk of falling badly unwell with coronavirus.

COVID-19 testing has been largely reserved only for those who fall seriously ill, with those who have minor symptoms being instead told to isolate at home and wait to get better.

Mr Roberts said: 'Most of Barrow is very compact: 40 to 50 per cent of Barrow is terraced housing and we've got a lot of flats, we've got a lot of deprivation, a lot of health inequalities.'

Figures show that Barrow has high levels of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with the national average – both of which make COVID-19 symptoms worse.

'We have quite a lot of historic respiratory problems from people who worked in old industry, in the ship yards,' Mr Roberts added.

And the constituency has higher than average numbers of patients with diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, which are all risk factors for the disease.

Barrow's population is also older than average, with 22.7 per cent of residents aged 65 to 90, compared with the England average of 18.3 per cent.

Coronavirus preys on the elderly, with over-80s 12 times more likely to fall critically ill after catching it, according to some estimates.

But Colin Cox, the director of public health for Cumbria, said the high infection rate may also be skewed by the fact Barrow is testing more people for the virus than other towns.

He told The Guardian: 'The rate of testing in Barrow has been two to three times higher than in many other parts of the north-west, so that will explain a fair chunk of it, but I don't think it will explain all of it.'

How Britain's R number plummeted when the lockdown was introduced and what it means for emerging from the other side

Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week put detailed science at the heart of Britain's coronavirus crisis and said the status of the lockdown now depends on the virus's reproduction number - known as the R.

Watching the number of new patients and the rate at which it goes up or down will be the best way officials can monitor how quickly the virus is spreading, which will in turn guide which risks the Government feels it can take in lifting lockdown.

The data that lays out Britain's R value will shape the lives of everyone in the UK over the coming weeks and months, and MailOnline here explains how:

What is the R number?

Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought' - or simply R.

It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect if the virus is reproducing in its ideal conditions.

Most epidemiologists - scientists who track disease outbreaks - believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has an R value of around 3.

But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark.

As an outbreak goes on, the R0 may be referred to more accurately as Re or just R, as other factors come into play to influence how well it is able to spread.

Estimates of the COVID-19 R vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment.

As an outbreak progress the R may simply be referred to as R, which means the effective rate of infection - the nought works on the premise that nobody in the population is protected, which becomes outdated as more people recover.

How does the reproductive rate compare to other infections?

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be at three times more contagious than the coronavirus that causes MERS (0.3 - 0.8).

Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and has an R0 value of between 12 and 18 if left uncontrolled. Widespread vaccination keeps it suppressed in most developed countries.

Chickenpox's R0 is estimated to be between 10 and 12, but this is controlled in the UK by herd immunity. So many people catch it as children and become immune to reinfection that it is unable to spread among adults.

Seasonal flu has an R value of around 1.5 but it mutates so often - there are often one or more new strains each year - that people cannot develop total immunity to it. Recovering from one strain of flu does not protect someone from others.

Ebola has an R0 of between 1.4 and 1.8 - this is low but it has so far only spread in countries with poor health facilities and its extremely high death rate (50 per cent) makes it a threat.

Mumps has an R0 of between 10 and 12, making it highly infectious, but the measles vaccine (MMR) protects most people in Britain from catching it.

The R0 for whooping cough, known medically as pertussis, is estimated to be 5.5. The NHS urges mothers to have the pertussis vaccine during pregnancy because they are able to pass immunity on to their baby naturally.

How is it calculated? And can scientists ever be sure of the number?

The R is not a set number and scientists calculate it by studying how fast the virus spreads in its perfect environment and also in society.

While the biology of the virus and the way it spreads - whether through coughs or blood, for example - will have some influence, but human behaviour is a bigger factor.

Tracking the rise in numbers of new cases, and how quickly the number of patients is doubling, are two of the best ways to estimate the R, according to senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, and author of the Maths of Life and Death, Dr Kit Yates.

He told MailOnline: 'Most modellers will give uncertainty ranges with their estimates suggesting R could be as high as this or as low as that.

'The R0 is not a fundamental property of the virus. It will change depending on the community through which the disease is passing.

'[It] depends on three factors: the transmissibility (how easily the disease passes between people); the infectious period (the longer it is, the more chances there are for an infectious person to pass on the disease); and the population through which the disease is passing.

'The more people there are and the more densely packed they are the easier it will be for the disease to spread, so we can't just take the R0 measured in one country and use it in another.'

Dr Jennifer Cole, a biological anthropologist at the Royal Holloway university in London said: 'It's incredibly difficult to calculate [the R0] without doing it in retrospect.

She explained that detailed data can show how fast the virus has spread but they are most accurate when you're looking back in time, not at the present day.

'At the moment we don't have exact numbers but we have a rough idea,' Dr Cole added.

'As long as you can say the R0 is between one and two, or between three and four, that's broadly enough to make the decisions you need to on social distancing.'

Did Britain's R number plummet when the lockdown was introduced?

Imperial College London's COVID-19 Response Team estimated the R0 value for the coronavirus was 2.4 in the UK before lockdown started.

This meant that, before Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the national shutdown on March 23, every 10 people who caught the virus would infect 24 others.

But scientists have since calculated that the rate has fallen below 1, meaning the crisis will peter out if the situation stays the same.

London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine researchers said in a paper published at the start of April that they thought the number was 0.62.

They surveyed 1,300 people about their movements and contacts and to judge how many people they were likely to have infected if they were carrying with the virus.

And England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told MPs in a Science and Technology Committee meeting last week the R was between 0.5 and 1.

His counterpart - the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - has also claimed it was at a similar rate, saying it is now between 0.6 and 0.9 across the UK.

In last night's Downing Street press conference, he suggested it was lower in London and added: 'It's not exactly uniform across the country'.

If the number is dropping, why are we still in lockdown?

Substantial drops in the virus's reproduction rate and the number of people infected are vital for the UK to even consider moving out of lockdown.

Number three on the Government's list of five criteria that must be met before lockdown can end is: 'Reliable data to show the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board'.

While Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty say they believe the R is now below one, the Government is, arguably, lacking the 'reliable data' to prove it.

COVID-19 testing had, until last week, been restricted to only hospital patients and medical staff, meaning the true scale of the outbreak was unclear.

Tests are being rolled out more widely now to people who think they might have the virus and also to more than 100,000 random people across the population.

A landmark report published by Imperial College London on March 30 showed politicians in the UK how the virus's reproduction rate could change as the country progressed through lockdown, using models from other countries that had introduced strict social distancing measures earlier (pictured in series). That report came after one by the same team that estimated up to half a million people could die if the Government didn't act, which was credited with persuading Boris Johnson to order the nation to stay at home on March 23

DENMARK'S RATE OF INFECTION ROSE AFTER SCHOOLS REOPENED Authorities in Denmark sent children back to schools two weeks ago and, since then the rate of coronavirus spread has increased, officials say. The country has had a relatively small outbreak, with just 9,356 officially diagnosed cases and 452 deaths. As a result, it has endured a shorter lockdown and already started to ease restrictions. However, the country's infectious diseases agency Status for Smittetrykket I Danmark (SSI), has found that the reproduction rate of the virus has risen to close to 1 - which could trigger another outbreak - since schools were reopened on April 20. It has risen to 0.6 to 0.9 in that time, The Local reported. Research published earlier this week will cause governments to think twice before reopening schools after it revealed that children appear to be just as likely to catch and spread COVID-19 as adults. In its status report the SSI said: 'There is no indication that there is an actual acceleration of the epidemic'.

Officials will now want to see the number of new cases being diagnosed stay low even as they scale up testing, which would show the virus is on its way out. If numbers continue to stay low and even to fall for weeks that would demonstrate the illness is spreading slowly.

Because so few people have had the disease and developed immunity, it is vital that the number of people currently infected drops as low as possible before lockdown lifts, to avoid those patients triggering another outbreak.

Bath's Dr Yates said: 'If the UK relaxes social distancing now, while most of the population is still susceptible, it runs the very real risk of a second wave.

'At the moment suggestions are that R0 might be around 0.7 which means we have a bit of room for manoeuvre in letting up on complete lockdown.

'Provided we keep R0 below 1 then the disease will continue to die out. The reason we are holding on to complete lockdown for so long is because we want to bring cases down to a very low level and the quickest way to do that is to keep R as low as possible.

'To some degree the impact of various different measures is quantifiable and modellers are running through a range of different scenarios in order to advise the government on the best policy.

'But until we actually go through the experiment of lifting the different restrictions we will not really know the effect on R. You can expect a great deal of caution in the measures the government start to relax. Expect it to be conservative initially.'

Movements in Government suggest the lockdown in its current state is likely to continue until June, after Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, yesterday said she thought it would still be too soon for change at next week's three-weekly review, due to be held on May 7.

Professor Whitty did, however, offer a glimmer of hope in a science and technology committee meeting last week when he said the R being below one 'gives a 'little bit of scope for manoeuvre and ticking some things off while still keeping it below 1'.

How will testing 100,000 people track the R value after lockdown?

Sir Patrick Vallance, Britain's chief scientific adviser, yesterday confirmed officials will move forward by using random population testing and numbers of official cases to work out how the R value changes in future.

He said at the Downing Street briefing: 'At the moment we're using a calculated R looking at all sorts of things including contacts, looking at genomics, looking at data from ambulances, hospital admissions, and so on, to calculate the R.'

As part of its three-point 'test, track, trace' plan, at least 25,000 people are being enrolled into a plan to test a sample of the population each month for a year to see if they are currently ill with the virus, tracking it over time.

In a second branch of the tracking project, people in 1,000 households across the country will submit to monthly blood testing to see if they have immunity to the coronavirus from being infected with it in the past.

The Government will also test 100,000 random people in a one-off swab testing scheme, to get an idea of what proportion of the population is infected at present.

Public Health England is carrying out ongoing antibody testing in its Porton Down laboratory to build up an idea of how many people have had the virus in the past and how they have developed immunity to it, and up to 10,000 people will be sent home antibody testing kits to add to this data.

Early results from these nationwide surveys are expected early this month and will help gather a picture of how many people are getting infected with the virus and how fast it's spreading.

The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is also trying to estimate how much the virus is spreading by surveying people about their movements and social contacts in recent days and weeks.

It estimated in April that the R had dropped from 2.6 to 0.62 in the first month of the UK's lockdown.

Will health chiefs publish the R number every day?

Health chiefs have yet to reveal whether they will publish the R number each day, despite the Prime Minister putting the number at the heart of the battle in his speech yesterday.

But ministers in Germany - which has been widely praised for its rigorous approach to halting the outbreak - do provide a daily update.

Situation reports published by the Robert Koch Institute, the country's centre for disease control, show the R0 dropped below one on April 15.

The number fluctuates on a daily basis - it was 0.9 on Tuesday and 0.75 yesterday, meaning it may not be a reliable day-by-day measure, but could be useful to track over time.

Watching the R number as the country comes out of lockdown would be useful because it could reveal exactly how different measures affect the rate of infection.

The lockdown happened all at once but will be lifted piece by piece, meaning calculating how each restriction affects the number cannot truly be known until it is taken away.

Dr Robin Thompson, a mathematical epidemiology researcher at University of Oxford, said: 'A key challenge now is to identify measures that can be relaxed that have only limited impacts on the value of R. 'One of the reasons that this is particularly challenging is that interventions were first introduced in the UK within a few days of each other. As a result, it is hard to disentangle the relative effects of different interventions on the reproduction number.'",15,Low,Right

Britain's crucial coronavirus reproduction rate has crept up to the point where the outbreak could spiral back out of control, government scientists today warned - on the same day officials announced the lowest weekly death toll since the end of March, with just 384 more victims.

Experts sitting on Number 10's SAGE panel saying the reproduction rate - known as the R - has risen to somewhere between 0.7 and 1 after officials claimed it was between 0.5 and 0.9 last week.

Officials must keep the number below 1 - meaning each patient infects one other person - otherwise the outbreak will start to grow again.

However, the latest data is three weeks out of date due to a lag in the government's mathematical modelling. The new number does not factor in the slight relaxation of Britain's lockdown measures, announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday.

The virus is still believed to be spreading faster in care homes than in the general community, and the peak of residents' deaths caused by COVID-19 appears to have peaked later than it did in hospitals, suggesting they will continue for longer.

The R is calculated by working out how fast the virus spreads by comparing data including hospital admissions, the number of patients in intensive care, death statistics and surveys to find out how many people members of the public are coming into contact with.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in today's Downing Street briefing: 'We're constantly keeping the R under review and it is one of our five tests... we don't think it's above 1, we think it's in a range, so it still meets that test.'

He said the R was an 'incredibly important data point' but was not the only thing politicians were considering as they ease the lockdown. He said a change in the range was 'important to look at' but officials were not re-thinking their decision to start easing lockdown. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, added that the real goal was to get the number of cases down, and the R was one of a number of ways to track this.

The chair of a Parliamentary science committee, Greg Clark MP, said officials should not focus too much on the R and should look at the wider picture. He said: 'It's not clear how the R rate in care homes is relevant to the R rates of people going about their daily business,' adding that the government's figure was clearly skewed by faster transmission in hospitals and nursing homes.

Official Department of Health statistics released today show 33,998 people have died since the outbreak began, meaning today's count marks the lowest seven-day total (2,757) since the week ending Friday, March 27. But other grim projections estimate the real toll could be upwards of 50,000.

It comes as data from the University of Cambridge and Public Health England has suggested that around 12 per cent of all people in England - 6.6million - have had the virus already.

It also estimated that only 24 people are catching the life-threatening illness in London every day, but government scientists are understood to be sceptical that the number of new infections is that low.

Separate statistics published today by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the coronavirus - which some scientists believe has been spreading in Britain since January - killed more people than cancer, dementia and heart disease combined in April, resulting in the deaths of 27,764 people.

The government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) has this week decided it thinks the R is between 0.7 and 1 by looking at hospitalisation and death rates, among other data.

An R number of 1 means that on average every person who is infected will infect 1 other person, meaning the total number of new infections is stable. If it is higher, the virus spreads faster and, if lower, the outbreak shrinks.

SAGE is confident that the number of infections is not increasing, and is very likely to be decreasing.

Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser to the Government, said: 'R is one of the important things you can track to understand an epidemic. If you can estimate R, then you have part of a reliable tool for planning how to combat the virus.

'If the R is higher than one that means this disease is growing exponentially and will keep on spreading to more and more people. To keep R below one and control the virus, it is vital that people stay alert and continue to follow the latest Government guidelines to the letter. In the coming weeks we will update this estimate regularly.'

NHS England today announced that 186 more people had died in its hospitals with the coronavirus, including a 15-year-old.

The 15-year-old has become the 13th person under the age of 20 to die in an NHS hospital since the outbreak began.

WHAT IS THE R, AND HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE IT? Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought' - or simply R. It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect if the virus is reproducing in its ideal conditions. The value has been estimated by the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). They assess data from hospitalisations, intensive care demand, deaths and the number of social contacts people have. Experts use multiple sources to get this information, including NHS hospital admissions, Office for National Statistics and CQC death figures and behavioural contact surveys. Using mathematical modelling, they are able to calculate the virus' spread. But a lag in the time it takes for coronavirus patients to fall unwell and die mean the R modelling is always roughly three weeks behind. Most epidemiologists - scientists who track disease outbreaks - believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has an R value of around 3. But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark. As an outbreak goes on, the R0 may be referred to more accurately as Re or just R, as other factors come into play to influence how well it is able to spread. Estimates of the COVID-19 R vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment. As an outbreak progress the R may simply be referred to as R, which means the effective rate of infection - the nought works on the premise that nobody in the population is protected, which becomes outdated as more people recover.

The oldest patient in today's statistics was 99 years old and 10 of them, aged between 30 and 94, had been healthy before they was diagnosed with the virus.

All the patients confirmed today had died since April 10.

Scotland announced 46 more people had died in its hospitals, along with 15 in Northern Ireland and nine in Wales.

Almost 230,000 people have been officially diagnosed with the viral disease but the true scale of Britain's outbreak is considerably larger, with government officials suggesting up to 6.6million are likely to have caught it in England alone.

An analysis by Cambridge University and Public Health England (PHE) suggested the disease could be eradicated in the capital within weeks at the current rate of transmission.

And their data - which was fed into No 10's scientific panel, SAGE - estimated up to 20 per cent of Londoners have already been infected. The rate across England is thought to be around 12 per cent.

But the same data also showed the crucial R rate - the average number of people an infected patient passes the virus on to - in London, as well as every other region had already fallen before lockdown on March 23.

It suggested the government's social distancing measures introduced a week before, which saw public transport use plummet and millions of Brits work from home instead of risk travelling, slowed the crisis.

The Cambridge-PHE data prompted some MPs to urge the government to commit to lifting lockdown on a region-by-region basis, with one urging ministers to consider it because 'it makes sense from a health perspective'.

The Cambridge team estimated that 1.8million people in London (20 per cent) have already had coronavirus.

They claimed between 10 and 53 people in the capital caught the virus on May 10, the day Boris Johnson announced a slight relaxation of some lockdown rules. The forecast also predicted it would have dropped to below 10 by today but that did not take into account the relaxation.

At the peak of the capital's crisis - calculated to be on the same day lockdown was announced - 213,000 are thought to have caught the infection.

Data shows COVID-19's ability to spread was already severely hampered in London before lockdown was introduced, and it suggested that social distancing measures introduced the week before worked, with millions of Londoners avoiding public transport and opting to work from home. This graph shows the number of daily deaths recorded in NHS hospitals in London (red bars) against the estimated R rate (blue line)

At the peak of the capital's crisis - calculated to be on the same day lockdown was announced - 213,000 are thought to have caught the infection (pictured: Londoners enjoying the sunshine at Clapham Common Park this afternoon)

At the start of the outbreak London was the worst affected part of the UK but the latest numbers suggest it is now ahead of every other area in terms of recovery (pictured: people walking at Potters Field near Tower Bridge today)

The data also broke down the 'attack rate' - the number of people infected in total - for each of the regions in England, saying that around 12 per cent of England had caught the virus in total. They say London has been the hardest-hit region, with around 20 per cent of the capital having caught the disease since Britain's outbreak began to spiral out of control, followed by the North West (14 per cent). In the Midlands and the North East and Yorkshire, the rate is estimated to be 11 per cent. While the team say around one in ten people in the East of England have already had COVID-19. The rate is just 8 per cent in the South East and even lower (5 per cent) in the South West

It calculated that the crucial 'R' reproduction rate has fallen to just 0.4 in the capital, with the number of new cases halving every 3.5 days.

LOCKDOWN 'COULD BE EASED REGIONALLY' AS DATA SHOWS 24 PEOPLE A DAY CATCHING VIRUS IN LONDON Lockdowns could be eased regionally, Number 10 today admitted on the back of promising data that suggested just 24 people a day are being struck down with the coronavirus in London. Downing Street's official spokesperson revealed some of the government's strict measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 could be eased 'at different rates in different parts of the country'. It comes after an analysis conducted by Cambridge University and Public Health England (PHE) experts suggested the disease could be eradicated in the capital within weeks at the current rate of transmission. And the data - which was fed into No 10's scientific panel SAGE - estimated up to 20 per cent of Londoners have already been infected. The rate across England is thought to be around 12 per cent. But the same data also showed the crucial R rate - the average number of people an infected patient passes the virus on to - in London, as well as every other region had already fallen before lockdown on March 23. It suggested the government's social distancing measures introduced a week before, which saw public transport use plummet and millions of Brits work from home instead of risk travelling, slowed the crisis. The Cambridge-PHE data prompted some MPs to urge the government to commit to lifting lockdown on a region-by-region basis, with one urging ministers to consider it because 'it makes sense from a health perspective'. In response to the speculation, Number 10's official spokesperson said: 'The roadmap that we set out does talk about the fact that we will be responsive to local infection rates and to the other data which is available and that it could lead to some of the measures being eased at different rates in different parts of the country and at the same time it could lead to some measures being re-imposed in different parts of the country but not others.' Leading scientists today described the study - based on death data from PHE, NHS England and regional health officials - as 'robust' but admitted any projections for the future are likely to rise drastically because the current model does not take into account the government's decision to slightly ease the lockdown last Sunday. One epidemiologist argued it was 'extremely unlikely' the number of new cases in London - the hardest-hit part of England - had dropped to as low as 24 and another called for officials to be transparent with the data, arguing it was 'not clear' from the available documents how the group had come to their estimates. Downing Street was today told to ditch its 'we-know-best attitude' and publish more secret evidence underpinning its coronavirus response, with the data being released by Cambridge and not PHE. Number 10 has been repeatedly criticised over the course of the COVID-19 outbreak over an apparent reluctance to release the scientific evidence its experts have provided. Conservative MPs today questioned what other vital information was being kept secret as they demanded a change in tack.

Meanwhile, the team's modelling shows only one death occurs in every 160 cases - giving it an infection-fatality rate of around 0.63 per cent. This suggests at the current rate, London's daily death toll would have dropped to a consistent level of zero in three weeks.

Three weeks is how long it can take for a COVID-19 patient to be diagnosed, their condition to become deadly and their death to be recorded.

At the start of the outbreak London was the worst affected part of the UK but the latest numbers suggest it is now ahead of every other area in terms of recovery. In contrast, the North East of England is recording 4,000 daily infections and has an R rate of 0.8, twice that of the capital.

The data - given to the Scientific Pandemic Influenza sub-group on Modelling - suggested COVID-19 kills around 0.63 per cent of people it infects - a similar figure to other estimates from around the world, which would make it around six times deadlier than seasonal flu. But they admitted it could be as low as 0.49 or as high as 0.81 per cent.

The Cambridge-PHE study showed a huge variation between different age groups, warning the virus has an infection-fatality rate of around 16 per cent for over-75s but it is below 0.018 per cent for anyone under the age of 44 - the equivalent of one death for every 10,000 cases.

For people between the ages of 45 and 64, the team said the death rate was around 0.28 per cent while the rate was approximately 1.8 per cent for people aged between 65 and 74.

The data also broke down the 'attack rate' - the number of people infected in total - for each of the regions in England, estimating around 12 per cent of England had caught the virus in total.

They say London has been the hardest-hit region, with around 20 per cent of the capital having caught the disease since Britain's outbreak began to spiral out of control, followed by the North West (14 per cent).

In the Midlands and the North East and Yorkshire, the rate is estimated to be 11 per cent. While the team say around one in ten people in the East of England have already had COVID-19. The rate is just 8 per cent in the South East and even lower (5 per cent) in the South West.

The report also delved into the crucial R rate of each region. It is vital that the number - which is thought to have been between 3.5 and 4 at the start of the crisis - stays below one, otherwise the outbreak will start to rapidly spiral again as people infect others around them at a faster rate.

Other data published yesterday, by the Office for National Statistics, saw officials estimate that around 148,000 people currently have the coronavirus in Britain.

The first round of random public testing identified only 33 positive cases of COVID-19 out of a sample of 10,705 people and estimated a national infection level of 0.27 per cent - one in every 370 people.

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said at yesterday's Downing Street briefing that the data represented 'really quite a low level of infection' in the community.

This suggests that 148,000 people had the virus at any given time between April 27 and May 10, that figure being the middle estimate between a low of 94,000 and high of 222,000. During that time 66,343 people were officially diagnosed.

The coronavirus is infecting people twice as fast in the North East of England than it is in London, real-time tracking of the reproductive 'R' rating shows

VACCINE HOPE AS TRIALS SHOW SUCCESS IN MONKEYS Hopes a coronavirus cure could be on the horizon were raised today after a vaccine developed in Britain showed promising signs in trials on monkeys. The University of Oxford's experimental jab strengthened the immune system in six rhesus macaques without causing any side effects. Within 28 days of being vaccinated, all of the animals had COVID-19 antibodies - produced by the body to give it some immunity from the virus. Researchers said the primates were able to fight off the virus before it penetrated deep into their lungs, where it can become deadly. The promising results come as human trials of the Oxford University vaccine are already underway, with results expected in a month's time. Scientists commenting on the study have described the findings as 'very encouraging', but warn it does not guarantee the same results in humans. They found a single vaccination dose was also effective in preventing damage to the lungs in the study on monkeys and mice. Some of the animals showed antibodies to the virus within two weeks, but all of them had the virus-fighting molecules within 28 days. The researchers found viral loads in the lower respiratory system were significantly reduced in the animals given the vaccine.

The data covers only a two-week window does not account for how many people may have had the virus and recovered since the outbreak began.

It found the rate of infection is six times higher in healthcare workers and carers than it is in the general population, the survey found.

While 1.33 per cent of people who worked in patient-facing roles in hospitals or homes tested positive for the virus, only 0.22 per cent of those with other jobs did so.

The numbers announced did not include anyone who was tested in a care home or a hospital, where the statisticians said 'rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be higher'.

Most official testing, which has picked up a total of 233,151 positive cases over the entire outbreak is being done in hospitals and care homes.

ONS data is soon expected to publish antibody data showing how many people have had the infection already but does not currently have enough data for a reliable estimate.

The current survey, of which this is the first set of data, will be ongoing as part of the government's 'test, track and trace' plan for getting out of lockdown and will be expanded to regular testing in more than 10,000 households.

How deadly the virus really is remains unknown but it is killing huge numbers of people with other health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure and dementia.

Office for National Statistics data today showed that COVID-19 has become the leading cause of death in England and Wales, killing people at almost triple the rate of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

In England in April it killed 587 in every 100,000 people, compared to 209 per 100,000 for dementia and 85 for heart disease.

The virus, which causes pneumonia, has killed more people in just two months than long-term lung diseases did in the entire of 2018, the ONS said.

The ONS's data shows that 33,841 people died with the coronavirus between March 1 and April 30 in England and Wales.

Of those patients, 95 per cent (32,143) were killed directly by the virus, it said, which was on par with the total number of deaths from long-term lung disease - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - in the whole of 2018.

In a normal year, dementia and Alzheimer's disease are the leading cause of death in England and Wales, accounting for around one in every seven fatalities (12.8 per cent).

The Office for National Statistics today revealed that COVID-19 was the leading cause of death in England and Wales in April by a considerable margin - it killed people at almost three times the rate of dementia and Alzheimer's disease

Dementia killed 69,748 people in 2018, according to past statistics from the ONS, and COVID-19 has killed almost half as many people in just two months.

One in five of the COVID-19 victims in March and April (6,887) also had dementia or Alzheimer's disease, showing how the virus is most devastating for the elderly and vulnerable.

This has been most noticeable in the nation's care homes, which care for around 400,000 people, approximately three quarters of whom have dementia.

More than a quarter of people to have died in care homes since the beginning of March - 12,526 out of 45,899 - have been linked to the coronavirus.

Even the numbers of people dying without the virus have been pushed up as a result of the pandemic, the ONS figures show.

For example the number of 'other deaths excluding COVID-19' in care homes more than doubled on April 11 to 807 from 375 on the same day last year, with 437 coronavirus deaths on top of those.

Sally Warren, director of policy at The King’s Fund health think-tank, said: 'The data indicates the grim toll the pandemic has taken on people living in care homes, revealing a 46 per cent increase in the total number of deaths amongst care home residents in England and Wales compared to the same period last year.

'Whilst we can’t yet fully understand all the factors at play, this is yet another worrying finding that should keep our attention firmly on the crisis in our care homes.'

The virus appears to have almost doubled the risk of dying for people living with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

The ONS report said: 'Compared with the five-year average, the rate of deaths due to dementia and Alzheimer's disease was significantly higher in April 2020, at 208.9 deaths per 100,000 persons compared with 113.8 deaths per 100,000 persons for the five-year average.'

Fiona Carragher, director of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: 'These are horrifying figures for anyone with a loved one with dementia, and show for the first time the true toll of coronavirus.

'Dementia is now the main underlying condition for COVID-19 deaths, accounting for one in five of total deaths.

'And beyond COVID-19, people have been dying from dementia at almost twice the usual rate.

'Right from the start, action to address the challenge has been too slow – and our research this week has found many care homes are still struggling, with over 40 per cent still not confident in their PPE supply.

'We need an urgent plan from Government to guarantee safety and support in care homes, and ministers must now look at long term support for people with dementia living at home, and tackle isolation from friends and families.

'People with dementia are dying in unprecedented numbers, the Government must step in right now to prevent further tragedy.'

How Britain's R number plummeted when the lockdown was introduced and what it means for emerging from the other side

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put detailed science at the heart of Britain's coronavirus crisis and said the status of the lockdown now depends on the virus's reproduction number - known as the R.

Watching the number of new patients and the rate at which it goes up or down will be the best way officials can monitor how quickly the virus is spreading, which will in turn guide which risks the Government feels it can take in lifting lockdown.

The data that lays out Britain's R value will shape the lives of everyone in the UK over the coming weeks and months, and MailOnline here explains how:

What is the R number?

Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought' - or simply R.

It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect.

Most epidemiologists - scientists who track disease outbreaks - believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has an R0 value of around 3.

But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark.

Estimates of the R0 vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment.

As an outbreak progress the R0 may simply be referred to as R, which means the effective rate of infection - the nought works on the premise that nobody in the population is protected, which becomes outdated as more people recover.

How does the reproductive rate compare to other infections?

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be at three times more contagious than the coronavirus that causes MERS (0.3 - 0.8).

Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and has an R0 value of between 12 and 18 if left uncontrolled. Widespread vaccination keeps it suppressed in most developed countries.

Chickenpox's R0 is estimated to be between 10 and 12, but this is controlled in the UK by herd immunity. So many people catch it as children and become immune to reinfection that it is unable to spread among adults.

Seasonal flu has an R value of around 1.5 but it mutates so often - there are often one or more new strains each year - that people cannot develop total immunity to it. Recovering from one strain of flu does not protect someone from others.

Ebola has an R0 of between 1.4 and 1.8 - this is low but it has so far only spread in countries with poor health facilities and its extremely high death rate (50 per cent) makes it a threat.

Mumps has an R0 of between 10 and 12, making it highly infectious, but the measles vaccine (MMR) protects most people in Britain from catching it.

The R0 for whooping cough, known medically as pertussis, is estimated to be 5.5. The NHS urges mothers to have the pertussis vaccine during pregnancy because they are able to pass immunity on to their baby naturally.

How is it calculated? And can scientists ever be sure of the number?

The R is not a set number and scientists calculate it by studying how fast the virus spreads in its perfect environment and also in society.

While the biology of the virus and the way it spreads - whether through coughs or blood, for example - will have some influence, but human behaviour is a bigger factor.

Tracking the rise in numbers of new cases, and how quickly the number of patients is doubling, are two of the best ways to estimate the R, according to senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, and author of the Maths of Life and Death, Dr Kit Yates.

He told MailOnline: 'Most modellers will give uncertainty ranges with their estimates suggesting R could be as high as this or as low as that.

'The R0 is not a fundamental property of the virus. It will change depending on the community through which the disease is passing.

'[It] depends on three factors: the transmissibility (how easily the disease passes between people); the infectious period (the longer it is, the more chances there are for an infectious person to pass on the disease); and the population through which the disease is passing.

'The more people there are and the more densely packed they are the easier it will be for the disease to spread, so we can't just take the R0 measured in one country and use it in another.'

Dr Jennifer Cole, a biological anthropologist at the Royal Holloway university in London said: 'It's incredibly difficult to calculate [the R0] without doing it in retrospect.

She explained that detailed data can show how fast the virus has spread but they are most accurate when you're looking back in time, not at the present day.

'At the moment we don't have exact numbers but we have a rough idea,' Dr Cole added.

'As long as you can say the R0 is between one and two, or between three and four, that's broadly enough to make the decisions you need to on social distancing.'

Did Britain's R number plummet when the lockdown was introduced?

Imperial College London's COVID-19 Response Team estimated the R0 value for the coronavirus was 2.4 in the UK before lockdown started.

This meant that, before Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the national shutdown on March 23, every 10 people who caught the virus would infect 24 others.

But scientists have since calculated that the rate has fallen below 1, meaning the crisis will peter out if the situation stays the same.

London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine researchers said in a paper published at the start of April that they thought the number was 0.62.

They surveyed 1,300 people about their movements and contacts and to judge how many people they were likely to have infected if they were carrying with the virus.

And England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told MPs in a Science and Technology Committee meeting recently the R was between 0.5 and 1.

His counterpart - the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - has also claimed it was at a similar rate, saying it is now between 0.6 and 0.9 across the UK.

In a Downing Street press conference, he said it was thought to be lower in London and added: 'It's not exactly uniform across the country'.

If the number is dropping, why are we still in lockdown?

Substantial drops in the virus's reproduction rate and the number of people infected are vital for the UK to even consider moving out of lockdown.

Number three on the Government's list of five criteria that must be met before lockdown can end is: 'Reliable data to show the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board'.

While Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty say they believe the R is now below one, the Government is, arguably, lacking the 'reliable data' to prove it.

COVID-19 testing had, until last month, been restricted to only hospital patients and medical staff, meaning the true scale of the outbreak was unclear.

Tests are being rolled out more widely now to people who think they might have the virus and also to more than 100,000 random people across the population.

A landmark report published by Imperial College London on March 30 showed politicians in the UK how the virus's reproduction rate could change as the country progressed through lockdown, using models from other countries that had introduced strict social distancing measures earlier (pictured in series). That report came after one by the same team that estimated up to half a million people could die if the Government didn't act, which was credited with persuading Boris Johnson to order the nation to stay at home on March 23

Officials will now want to see the number of new cases being diagnosed stay low even as they scale up testing, which would show the virus is on its way out. If numbers continue to stay low and even to fall for weeks that would demonstrate the illness is spreading slowly.

Because so few people have had the disease and developed immunity, it is vital that the number of people currently infected drops as low as possible before lockdown lifts, to avoid those patients triggering another outbreak.

Bath's Dr Yates said: 'If the UK relaxes social distancing now, while most of the population is still susceptible, it runs the very real risk of a second wave.

'At the moment suggestions are that R0 might be around 0.7 which means we have a bit of room for manoeuvre in letting up on complete lockdown.

DENMARK'S RATE OF INFECTION ROSE AFTER SCHOOLS REOPENED Authorities in Denmark sent children back to schools last month and, in the weeks that followd, the rate of coronavirus spread increased, officials say. The country has had a relatively small outbreak, with just 10,627 officially diagnosed cases and 529 deaths. As a result, it has endured a shorter lockdown and already started to ease restrictions. However, the country's infectious diseases agency Status for Smittetrykket I Danmark (SSI), found that the reproduction rate of the virus rose close to 1 - which could trigger another outbreak - after schools were reopened on April 20. In its status report the SSI said: 'There is no indication that there is an actual acceleration of the epidemic'.

'Provided we keep R0 below 1 then the disease will continue to die out. The reason we are holding on to complete lockdown for so long is because we want to bring cases down to a very low level and the quickest way to do that is to keep R as low as possible.

'To some degree the impact of various different measures is quantifiable and modellers are running through a range of different scenarios in order to advise the government on the best policy.

'But until we actually go through the experiment of lifting the different restrictions we will not really know the effect on R. You can expect a great deal of caution in the measures the government start to relax. Expect it to be conservative initially.'

Movements in Government suggest the lockdown in its current state is likely to continue until June, after Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, yesterday said she thought it would still be too soon for change at next week's three-weekly review, due to be held on May 7.

Professor Whitty did, however, offer a glimmer of hope in a science and technology committee meeting last week when he said the R being below one 'gives a 'little bit of scope for manoeuvre and ticking some things off while still keeping it below 1'.

How will testing 100,000 people track the R value after lockdown?

Sir Patrick Vallance, Britain's chief scientific adviser, yesterday confirmed officials will move forward by using random population testing and numbers of official cases to work out how the R value changes in future.

He said at the Downing Street briefing: 'At the moment we're using a calculated R looking at all sorts of things including contacts, looking at genomics, looking at data from ambulances, hospital admissions, and so on, to calculate the R.'

As part of its three-point 'test, track, trace' plan, at least 25,000 people are being enrolled into a plan to test a sample of the population each month for a year to see if they are currently ill with the virus, tracking it over time.

Germany's Robert Koch Institute is publishing the government's daily best estimates of the country's R0, showing it dropped by almost during April's lockdown

In a second branch of the tracking project, people in 1,000 households across the country will submit to monthly blood testing to see if they have immunity to the coronavirus from being infected with it in the past.

The Government will also test 100,000 random people in a one-off swab testing scheme, to get an idea of what proportion of the population is infected at present.

Public Health England is carrying out ongoing antibody testing in its Porton Down laboratory to build up an idea of how many people have had the virus in the past and how they have developed immunity to it, and up to 10,000 people will be sent home antibody testing kits to add to this data.

Early results from these nationwide surveys are expected early this month and will help gather a picture of how many people are getting infected with the virus and how fast it's spreading.

The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is also trying to estimate how much the virus is spreading by surveying people about their movements and social contacts in recent days and weeks.

It estimated in April that the R had dropped from 2.6 to 0.62 in the first month of the UK's lockdown.

Will health chiefs publish the R number every day?

Health chiefs have yet to reveal whether they will publish the R number each day, despite the Prime Minister putting the number at the heart of the battle in his speech yesterday.

But ministers in Germany - which has been widely praised for its rigorous approach to halting the outbreak - do provide a daily update.

Situation reports published by the Robert Koch Institute, the country's centre for disease control, show the R0 dropped below one on April 15.

The number fluctuates on a daily basis - it was 0.9 on Tuesday and 0.75 yesterday, meaning it may not be a reliable day-by-day measure, but could be useful to track over time.

Watching the R number as the country comes out of lockdown would be useful because it could reveal exactly how different measures affect the rate of infection.

The lockdown happened all at once but will be lifted piece by piece, meaning calculating how each restriction affects the number cannot truly be known until it is taken away.

Dr Robin Thompson, a mathematical epidemiology researcher at University of Oxford, said: 'A key challenge now is to identify measures that can be relaxed that have only limited impacts on the value of R.

'One of the reasons that this is particularly challenging is that interventions were first introduced in the UK within a few days of each other. As a result, it is hard to disentangle the relative effects of different interventions on the reproduction number.'",15,Low,Right

The University of Oxford's experimental jab strengthened the immune system in six rhesus macaques without causing any side effects.

Within 28 days of being vaccinated, all of the animals had COVID-19 antibodies - produced by the body to give it some immunity from the virus.

Researchers said the primates were able to fight off the virus before it penetrated deep into their lungs, where it can become deadly.

The promising results come as human trials of the Oxford University vaccine are already underway, with results expected within a months' time.

Scientists commenting on the study have described the findings as 'very encouraging', but warn it does not guarantee the same results in humans.

They found a single vaccination dose was also effective in preventing damage to the lungs in the study on monkeys and mice.

Some of the animals showed antibodies to the virus within two weeks, but all of them had the virus-fighting molecules within 28 days.

The researchers found viral loads in the lower respiratory system were significantly reduced in the animals given the vaccine.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VACCINES CREATED BY OXFORD AND IMPERIAL COLLEGE? The science behind both vaccine attempts hinges on recreating the 'spike' proteins that are found all over the outside of the COVID-19 viruses. Both will attempt to recreate or mimic these spikes inside the body. The difference between the two is how they achieve this effect. Imperial College London will try to deliver genetic material (RNA) from the coronavirus which programs cells inside the patient's body to recreate the spike proteins. It will transport the RNA inside liquid droplets injected into the bloodstream. The team at the University of Oxford, on the other hand, will genetically engineer a virus to look like the coronavirus - to have the same spike proteins on the outside - but be unable to cause any infection inside a person. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. If the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person's bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future. The same process is thought to happen in people who catch COVID-19 for real, but this is far more dangerous - a vaccine will have the same end-point but without causing illness in the process.

It suggests the jab prevents the disease from multiplying and spreading deep in the lungs.

Stephen Evans, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the results were 'very definitely' good news.

He said: 'The most important finding to me is the combination of considerable efficacy in terms of viral load and subsequent pneumonia, but no evidence of immune-enhanced disease.

'The latter has been a concern for vaccines in general, for example with vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and for SARS vaccines.

'This was a definite theoretical concern for a vaccine against SARS Cov-2 and finding no evidence for it in this study is very encouraging.'

Dr Penny Ward, professor of pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, said: 'It is helpful to see that monkeys vaccinated with this SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not have any evidence of enhanced lung pathology and that, despite some evidence of upper respiratory tract infection by SARS COV2 after high viral load virus challenge, monkeys given the vaccine did not have any evidence of pneumonia.

'These results support the ongoing clinical trial of the vaccine in humans, the results of which are eagerly awaited.'

The paper has not yet been published in a scientific journal or scrutinised by other scientists.

Developing vaccinations usually takes many months or years but researchers around the world are racing towards human trial - including two teams in the UK.

They say the process has been made easier because the virus is not mutating and is similar to other viruses seen in the past.

Researchers from Oxford University, started human trials last month, while a separate team from Imperial College London are due to start testing the jabs on humans in June.

While the Oxford vaccine will try to stimulate the immune system using a common cold virus taken from chimps, the researchers at Imperial are using droplets of liquid to carry the genetic material they need to get into the bloodstream.

Both will then work, in theory, by recreating parts of the coronavirus inside the patient and forcing their immune system to learn how to fight it.

The Oxford vaccine, known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 will be trialled on up to 510 people out of a group of 1,112, all of whom will be aged 18 to 55.

Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said that 'several hundred' people have been vaccinated and results are expected by June.

The 67-year-old told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the challenge now is to be able to manufacture at scale once it is approved by the regulators.

At the end of last month a team of researchers at Oxford started testing a Covid-19 vaccine in human volunteers. Half of these will receive the vaccine candidate and the other half - the control group - will receive a widely available meningitis vaccine.

A separate team from Imperial College London are also due to start testing jabs on humans in June. While the Oxford vaccine will try to stimulate the immune system using a common cold virus taken from chimps, the Imperial experts will use droplets of liquid to carry the genetic material they need to get into the bloodstream.

Sorrento Therapeutics, based in San Diego, claims its STI-1499 antibody stopped coronavirus from entering 100 percent of healthy human cells in petri dish experiments.

It's one of several antibodies planned to be combined for a drug 'cocktail' Sorrento is developing in collaboration with Mt Sinai School of Medicine in New York.

In a press release, Sorrento said it could produce up to 200,000 doses of the antibody a month - a production timeline that would likely make the drug available months sooner than a COVID-19 vaccine is expected.

The company has filed for emergency approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but has not yet received the green light.

Stocks for Sorrento soared by nearly 220 percent on the heels of the announcement.

Scientists at a California biotech company say they've discovered an antibody that can '100%' block the coronavirus from entering human cells - and they're claiming it's a 'cure'

Amid the pandemic, scientists at Sorrento began testing its library of billions of antibodies for potential to protect against coronavirus

Stocks for Sorrento surged nearly 220% on the heels of its announcement

'We want to emphasize there is a cure,' Sorrento's CEO, Dr Henry Ji, told Fox.

'There is a solution that works 100 percent.

'If we have the neutralizing antibody in your body, you don't need the social distancing. You can open up a society without fear.'

However, this is a significant 'if.' Promising though its effects on the virus were in lab tests on human cells, the company can't rightfully say that it has blocked the the infection in the human body.

The antibody has not yet been tested in people, so how it might behave inside the body and its potential side effects are totally unknown.

It comes the same day that the Trump administration's social distancing guidelines to slow the spread are expiring, and as many states begin to reopen despite expert warnings that relaxing restrictions may trigger a devastating second wave of infections.

Sorrento's drug, dubbed STI-1499 is one about a dozen antibodies - immune cells that neutralize pathogens like coronavirus - that the company discovered had some effect on coronavirus.

A cocktail of antibodies could act like a 'protective shield' for human cells, preventing the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 - from entering them.

It blocks the virus from its primary doorway, a receptor on the surface of human cells, the ACE2 receptor.

'This puts its arms around the virus. It wraps around the virus and moves them out of the body,' Dr Ji told Fox of what his company has seen in lab experiments.

'When the antibody prevents a virus from entering a human cell, the virus cannot survive.

'If they cannot get into the cell, they cannot replicate. So it means that if we prevent the virus from getting the cell, the virus eventually dies out. The body clears out that virus.'

Multiple companies and universities around the world have been exploring the use of antibodies to treat coronavirus.

Encouragingly, the antibody discovered by Sorrento belongs to a class called 'neutralizing,' or binding antibodies.

They fully and specifically bind to the part of the virus that fits like a lock in a key with parts of human cells.

According to Dr Derek Lowe, an organic chemist who writes for Science Translational Medicine, these both block the virus and sound the alarm to the rest of the immune system to mount a response, too.

These are preferable to other types of antibodies which don't entirely block the virus's effects, and could accidentally make it easier for it to enter human cells.

Dr Lowe notes that neutralizing antibodies, in general, also have the potential to act like 'temporary vaccines,' preventing coronavirus infection in people who haven't already contracted it.

San Diego-based Sorrento said it can start making 200,00 doses of its antibody a month while awaiting FDA approval f

Trials have already begun using blood plasma from recovered patients - which presumptively contains antibodies - to treat people still suffering the infection.

Sorrento had collected a library of billions of antibodies over the past decade, and started systematically screening them for potential against coronavirus as what began as an outbreak exploded into a pandemic.

Scientists there identified about a dozen antibodies that had some effect on the virus.

As a result, they laid pans to create a cocktail of multiple antibodies, in the hope that, if the virus mutated to become immune to one antibody, others could provide back-up protection.

STI-1499 is the clear front-runner to be the 'first' candidate antibody in the cocktail.

'Our STI-1499 antibody shows exceptional therapeutic potential and could potentially save lives following receipt of necessary regulatory approvals,' said Dr Ji.

As of Friday, more than 1.46 million Americans had coronavirus, and more than 87,000 have died.

'We at Sorrento are working day and night to complete the steps necessary to get this product candidate approved and available to the waiting public.'

In the meantime, Sorrento said that it's reaching out to potential manufacturing partners and looking to the US government for support in the hopes of making 'tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand,' according to its statement.

Production of antibodies can pose challenges. It requires a rather complex process, and has to be closely monitored for contamination and other issues, Dr Lowe wrote.

It did not, however, specify a start date or plan for human clinical trials.

There is no proven cure for coronavirus. Earlier this month, Gilead's antiviral, remdesivir, was given emergency FDA approval after it showed slim but promising benefits for survival and recovery times in a National Institutes of Health (NIH) study.

The FDA has not yet approved the use of antibody-rich plasma for treating coronavirus, but is currently investigating it",15,Low,Right

And in order to do so, it's asking hospitals to help it sign up the sickest coronavirus patients, because in order to find the genes that may put some people at risk of becoming sicker, they need the genes of those people.

Launched in April 6, more than 500,000 people around the world who were already 23andMe users have enrolled, including 7,000 people who have tested positive for coronavirus.

But the central goal of the research is to identify not just who gets coronavirus, but who gets sickest from it, and there simply wasn't enough data on this group among 23andMe customers.

So the company is now offering to send free test kits to people hospitalized with 'severe' COVID-19. But many of these patients need oxygen support, including being put on a ventilator, leaving them unconscious and unable to speak for themselves.

The company is reaching out to hospitals to help them recruit up to 10,000 additional participants, a senior scientist told Stat News.

Personal genetic testing company 23andMe this week expanded its DNA study that aims to find genes that may make some people at greater risk getting sickest from coronavirus by recruiting up to 10,000 non-customers with 'severe' infections

Every day, in New York alone, hundreds of new patients are still being hospitalized for coronavirus.

Although hospitalization and death rates are far higher among older patients or those with underlying health conditions, 26.1 out of every 100,000 people hospitalized for coronavirus are in their 30s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Forty-five out of every 100,000 are in their 40s.

Still, most younger people develop only mild to moderate disease after being infected.

Little is left to explain why some of these young, otherwise healthy young people get so sick.

Some scientists - including those who work at 23andMe - are looking to genetics for an explanation.

Determining what gene variants or collection thereof might put some people at greater risk for a disease than others requires collecting and sequencing the full set of DNA from a wide swath of the population - often hundreds of thousands of people - in what's called a genome-wide association study (GWA).

23andMe is only one of many groups investigating the role of genetics in coronavirus severity.

Its competitor Ancestry.com is also conducting a similar study, but most of this research is being done by universities, not private companies. Many of these institutions are collaborating through the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (COVID-19 hg).

Dr Jean-Laurent Casanova of Rockefeller University is one of the scientists involved in COVID-19 hg (not in 23andMe's research), and he thinks that these rare, young patients who fall so desperately, seemingly at random, may have invisible risk factors, called 'inborn errors of immunity,' he told DailyMail.com in a recent interview.

He and his international team of collaborators are recruiting coronavirus patients in their 30s, 40s and 50s whose illnesses are life-threatening and plan to sequence and test their genetics, looking for a piece of code that makes them more vulnerable.

In addition to obvious traits like our hair and eye color, our DNA also contains instructions for our bodies to build everything from brain cells and bones to the core of our immune system.

Chronic health conditions like heart and lung diseases and diabetes impact the immune system too, diminishing our natural ability to fight off infection.

Some people are born immunodeficient due to genetic conditions or variations.

But Dr Casanova is one of the scientists at the forefront of the discovery that genetics may also make some people susceptible to specific infections, not unlike the BRCA genes' effects on risks for certain malignant tumors, particularly breast cancer.

'Some people have genetic variations that make them selectively vulnerable to that particularly virus that are silent until the moment that the patient is hit by this specific virus,' Dr Casanova explained in a Skype interview with DailyMail.com.

But they've already begun collecting patients from around the world - most of them are in the US and France - to study.

'We're recruiting patients, the relatively rare ones with unexplained, severe disease' Dr Casanova said.

But that's difficult in the case of coronavirus, a disease so new that only 4.3 million people around the globe are known to have it, and many more are suspected to be undiagnosed.

Although 23andMe has about 10 million customers who have used its service. But people have to consent to be involved in any study involving their health data.

Universities and their partner hospitals already have patient data, and safeguards in place to protect it.

A private company like 23andMe faces a steeper data collection challenge because they have to find these patients through targeted ads or by going through hospitals, as they are now attempting.

'Opening up the research to individuals with more severe symptoms will increase our power to learn how genes play a role in the severity of this disease,' said Dr Joyce Tung, 23andMe’s Vice President of Research, in the company's blog post about the project.

As it does in most of its projects, 23andMe promises to protect patient privacy by de-identifying their genomic data - removing any of its links to their names and registrations.

'If you consent to participate in this study, 23andMe may only share your de-identified, individual-level genetic and survey data, with qualified research collaborators for COVID-19 and related research,' its website about the COVID-19 project says.

'Individual-level data means related to a single person. ""De-identified"" means that the individual-level data we share about you with researchers will be stripped of components that could directly identify you (such as name, date of birth, and address).'

But, the company's website admits that, while it is required by law to protect customer data, it can also be compelled by law to turn it over.",15,Low,Right

Investigators will enroll approximately 2,000 adults across the US who all must have a confirmed case the virus and classic symptoms such as fever, coughing and shortness of breath.

The study will assess whether the combination of drugs can prevent hospitalization and death from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.

According to a press release from the NIH, the first participant enrolled on Thursday in San Diego, California.

President Donald Trump has touted hydroxychloroquine in the past as a 'game-changer' in treating coronavirus. Pictured: Trump walks from Marine One to board Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, May 14

'We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19,' said Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the NIH's National Institutes of Health and Infectious Diseases.

Repurposing existing drugs is an attractive option because these medications have undergone extensive testing, allowing them to move quickly into clinical trials and accelerating their potential approval for COVID-19 treatment.'

Fauci noted that there has been anecdotal evidence of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin improving patients' conditions.

However, he added: 'Ee need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.'

Study participants will randomly be assigned to take home either a combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine - donated by Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd - or two placebos.

Those who've been given the experimental treat will take 400 milligrams (mg) of hydroxychloroquine twice on the first day and 200 mg twice daily for six days.

Additionally, they will take 500 mg of azithromycin on the first day and 250 mg per day for four days.

Participants will be asked to record their symptoms, how well they adhered to treatment, and any side effects they experienced over 20 days.

Researchers will conduct either a telephone or in-person follow-up followed by one at three months and another at six months.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

Not long after, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the drug.

However, reports began to emerge that has potentially serious side effects, including altering the heartbeat in a way that could lead to sudden death.

This lead to the FDA issuing a formal warning and advising that hydroxychloroquine not be used except in clinical trials and in hospital settings.

Current studies have offered mixed results.

A study from New York found that patients received no benefits whether they took just the drug or paired it with azithromycin.

Another found that when the drugs were paired with zinc, patients had a higher chance of covering well enough to be discharged and were less likely to die.",15,Low,Right

Selinexor, known by its brand name Xpovio, is made by Massachusetts-based Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc and is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat multiple myeloma, a cancer that forms in white blood cells.

Researchers say the medication prevents the virus from replicating, or multiplying, in patients' cells.

According to Karyopharm, the goal of the trial is to see if a low dose of the drug can keep the most critically ill patients off of ventilators.

Selinexor blocks the protein XPO1, which plays a role in replicating the virus throughout the body and in the body's inflammatory response.

The team believes the drug will also help reduce the over-production of cytokines, known as a cytokine storm.

This occurs when the body attacks its own cells and tissues instead of just fighting off the virus.

More than 230 patients have been enrolled in the second phase of the study, which is taking place in 40 hospitals across the US, Europe and Israel.

Researchers compared patients taking 20mg of selinexor orally three times a week for two weeks to patients taking a placebo

'We're encouraged by what we are seeing,' Karyopharm CEO Dr Michael Kauffman told NBC Boston.

'We haven't seen any safety issues that we are worried about. So it seems to be a tolerated therapy, which is important.'

Selinexor isn't the only cancer drug being used as an experimental treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

Chimerix, a company based in North Carolina is planning a clinical trial to test if drug derived from the blood thinner heparin for a form of leukemia reduces bleeding and inflammation in coronavirus patients.

Additionally, a clinical trial is underway at Stanford Medicine to see if a drug called interferon-lambda - used to treat other viruses, and cancer - can keep people who have recently tested positive for coronavirus out of the hospital.

'We all need to work as hard as we possibly can and as fast as we can to study all different approaches and try to knock this thing on its head so we can help people recover and can move on,' Kauffman told NBC Boston.

Less than one percent of about 5,000 patients from around the US who received plasma from people who had recovered from the virus suffered 'serious adverse effects.'

Additionally, one week later, only about 15 percent died, which the researchers say is low considering two-thirds were in intensive care.

Health experts say plasma is a potentially changing treatment but, with few donations, doctors have to decide which patients receive it and which do not.

Plasma therapy is when the liquid portion of blood is taken from a recovered coronavirus patient and transferred into a sick patient in the hopes they will develop the antibodies needed to fight off the infection.

Among 5,000 critically or severely ill patients from across the US who received the treatment, just 1% suffered side effects, Pictured: A nurse holds up a bag of plasma donated by a recovered coronavirus patient at the Vall d'Hebron hospital in Barcelona, Spain, April 24

For the study, published on pre-print server medRxiv.org - meaning it has not been peer-reviewed yet - researchers from the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University and Michigan State University looked at 5,000 coronavirus patients across the nation.

All of the patients either had severe or life threatening cases of COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the virus, and 66 percent were in intensive care units.

Convalescent plasma therapy is an experimental treatment in which plasma from a recovered COVID-19 patient is used on an infected patient in critical condition.

The hope is that the antibodies and immunity in the blood of a healthy person will be transferred to a sick person.

From this, the infected person will then develop the antibodies needed to fight off the coronavirus.

The treatment was first used during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, a situation not far removed from the current pandemic.

People can donate plasma more than once, but have to wait several weeks after donating.

Researchers found that, of the 5,000 patients, just 36 - less that one percent - suffered 'serious adverse events' in the first four hours after transfusion.

However, just two were determined to be definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion rather than from another condition.

Seven days after the transfusion, just 14.9 percent of the patients had died.

'Given the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically-ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive,' the authors wrote.

'These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.'

The team says it cannot definitively say if the plasma improved the patients' conditions, but that the findings are evidence that clinical trials are safe to begin.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of convalescent plasma for treatment in March.

'Prior experience with respiratory viruses and limited data that have emerged from China suggest that convalescent plasma has the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of illness caused by COVID-19,' the agency said in a statement on April 16.

However, the FDA added it must be given on case-by-case basis, and patients who receive it must be experiencing conditions such as respiratory failure or multiple organ failure.",15,Low,Right

Data from China has shown that acute kidney injury among hospitalized COVID-19 patients can range five percent to 23 percent. In the US, it may be even higher.

The results from the studies may explain why coronavirus patients develop blood clots, strokes and need be placed on dialysis despite the virus being described as a respiratory disease.

In one study, published in the journal Kidney International, a team from Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research looked at nearly 5,500 patients hospitalized between Match 1 and April 5 at Northwell in New York.

'In Northwell, at least in the nephrology division...we were noticing around like maybe early March, mid-March the number of patients we were being consulted on was very high compared to the normal December, January season,' Dr Kenar Jhaveri, associate chief of nephrology at Northwell, told DailyMail.com

'A lot of these patients were requiring dialysis so that kind of gotten thinking: ""What is the rate? When is it happening? Why is it happening?'""

About 12 of 27 patients who were autopsied had virus levels in their kidneys (above)

They found that more than one-third - 36.6 percent - developed acute kidney injury, which occurs when the kidneys fail and become unable to filter out waste.

Of the patients with kidney failure, 14.3 percent required dialysis,

Additionally, the researchers founds that kidney failure occurred early on in coronavirus patients, with about 37.3 percent of patients arriving at the hospital with failing kidneys developing the condition within the first 24 hours of being admitted.

What's more, of 1,000 patients who needed to be placed on a ventilator, about 90 percent developed acute kidney failure.

However, Jhaveri said this is more likely because the patients are very sick rather than due tot he virus itself.

He says the findings can help areas that haven't seen a coronavirus surge yet, or that will have one in the fall, to prepare by stocking up on dialysis equipment and having plenty of staff available.

'This disease is multi-system and not just the lungs, and the kidneys can get affected,' Jhaveri said.

In a second report, researchers at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany performed autopsies on 27 patients who died from coronavirus.

They found the virus in several organs including the brain, lungs, pharynx, heart, liver and kidneys.

Although the highest viral load was found in the respiratory tract at least 12 patients had virus cells in the kidneys.

There seemed to be particularly higher viral loads in several compartments of the kidneys, even in those without a history of kidney disease.

'On the basis of these findings, renal tropism is a potential explanation of commonly reported new clinical signs of kidney injury in patients with Covid-19, even in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are not critically ill,' they wrote in a letter to the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.",15,Low,Right

Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that droplets of spit that can contain infectious particles of coronavirus can linger in the air for eight to 14 minutes after someone speaks.

Especially concerning, even a person with no symptoms of coronavirus can leave a trail of coronavirus in the air after talking.

The findings underscore the importance of wearing a mask in public and come as many states are beginning to reopen small indoor spaces like restaurants and salons.

Just talking in confined spaces like offices could spread coronavirus, a new NIH study found

Government scientists used lasers to illuminate droplets of saliva flying from people's mouths as they talked, yelled or sang.

Cameras kept rolling for 80 minutes, recording the spit droplets lit up y the lasers.

They found that spit can travel through the air for between eight and 12 minutes, with particles that come from people who are yelling lasting longer.

One person talking loudly for just one minute can produce at least 1,000 viral particles that stay in the air for eight minutes.

'These therefore could be inhaled by others and...trigger a new SAR-CoV-2 infection,' the researchers wrote, referring to the virus that causes COVID-19.

How much virus any given person spewed while speaking varied widely.

Some people's spit droplets contained twice the average concentration of virus previously observed in other experiments per minute of talking.

And the virus particles coming from there 'are sufficiently small to reach the lower respiratory tract, which is associated with an increased adverse disease outcome,' the study authors wrote in the Proceedings of the National Association for Science (PNAS).

The research did not look at the effect of masks on virus spread through tiny droplets of spit emitted while talking, but underscores the importance of social distancing and protective face covering to minimize the spread of the disease, especially in enclosed indoor spaces (file)

During the last week, more and more people emerged from their homes, even in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic and some - like these students - are not even wearing masks

In other words, being in the same small room as a speaker with coronavirus could leave not just your nose and throat vulnerable to infection, but your lungs.

On average, however, speakers had a lower concentration of virus in their spit particles, making it unlikely that they could infect someone else.

The likelihood that any given particle of spit emitted while one of these people was talking would contain coronavirus, then, was low: only 0.01 percent.

Nonetheless, it raises considerable concerns.

In many states across the US, people are already returning to offices, nail and hair salons and even restaurants (although many are required to keep customers socially distanced, operating at only a fraction of their capacity).

Even if people remain six or more feet apart, there's still a risk for infection.

It's not hard to imagine eating in a restaurant, say six feet away from the next table, where two people have masks off to eat and converse.

If one of them had coronavirus and you were to get up to walk to the bathroom within eight minutes of their speaking, you could easily walk through a fine, undetectable mist of their saliva droplets, and inhale viral particles.

Findings that norma activities like taking and shaking hands may be able to spread coronavirus are drawing concerns that the way people socialize will be long changed by the pandemic

The new study 'demonstrates how normal speech generates airborne droplets that can remain suspended for tens of minutes or longer and are eminently capable of transmitting disease in confined spaces,' the study authors wrote.

'This suggests that virus from an infected individual could be transmitted this way in confined spaces, however there is no direct analysis of the presence of viruses in the droplets or their ability to pass on infection,' said Dr Lawrence Young, professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick said.

'One of the main assumptions in this paper is that each virus particle in a droplet is equally capable of causing an infection.

'We don't know that this is the case for Sars-CoV-2. The study is novel and supports the view that respiratory and aerosol transmission are significant mechanisms of virus spread.

'It adds weight to the need for social distancing and raises important issues about the potential for the virus to spread in confined spaces such as offices and factories...[and] highlights the problem of virus transmission from infected individuals who do not have symptoms.'",15,Low,Right

Up to 222,000 people in England may be infected with the coronavirus right now, according to a government testing survey, while scientists estimate that a third of the population have already had it and recovered.

The first round of random public testing has identified only 33 positive cases of COVID-19 out of a sample of 10,705 people and estimated a national infection level of 0.27 per cent - one in every 370 people.

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said at today's Downing Street briefing that the data represented 'really quite a low level of infection' in the community.

This suggests that 148,000 people had the virus at any given time between April 27 and May 10, that figure being the middle estimate between a low of 94,000 and high of 222,000. During that time 66,343 people were officially diagnosed.

And the rate of infection is six times higher in healthcare workers and carers than it is in the general population, the survey found. While 1.33 per cent of people who worked in patient-facing roles in hospitals or homes tested positive for the virus, only 0.22 per cent of those with other jobs did so.

Numbers announced today did not include anyone who was tested in a care home or a hospital, where the statisticians said 'rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be higher'.

Most official testing, which has picked up a total of 233,151 positive cases over the entire outbreak is being done in hospitals and care homes. But researchers at the University of Manchester have said this is likely huge under-estimate of the number of people who have had the illness already.

Those scientists, who studied the rate of infection in local areas, predicted that 29 per cent of everyone in Britain, more than 19million people, had already caught the infection by April 19, when 73,000 people had been diagnosed.

However, doubts were cast over the accuracy of this by a top scientist because data from other countries shows much lower levels of infection - for example, a study in Spain found evidence of just five per cent of people being infected and even in New York, which was hit worse than the UK, there is no proof that more than a quarter caught the illness.

Britain's own chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said last week that he thought around four per cent of people in the UK had been exposed so far, rising to 10 per cent exposure in London.

ONS data is soon expected to publish antibody data showing how many people have had the infection already but does not currently have enough data for a reliable estimate.

The current survey, of which this is the first set of data, will be ongoing as part of the government's 'test, track and trace' plan for getting out of lockdown and will be expanded to regular testing in more than 10,000 households.

Its early findings come as the Department of Health today announced 428 more deaths from the coronavirus across the UK, taking the total number of fatalities to 33,614. The real figure is believed to be over 50,000.

The Office for National Statistics estimates that somewhere between 94,000 and 222,000 people in England currently have the coronavirus, putting their average estimate at 148,000. This represents 0.27 per cent of the population, and means approximately one in every 370 people is carrying the virus

England's top statisticians estimate that 0.27 per cent of the population has been infected with COVID-19 on any given day over the past fortnight - equal to around 148,000 people and certainly between 94,000 and 222,000

The data from the ONS showed that people's age did not appear to have any bearing on how likely they were to be diagnosed with the virus.

It found that approximately 0.32 per cent of people aged two to 19, or 50-69 were infected with the virus, along with 0.26 per cent of 20 to 49-year-olds and 0.23 per cent of over-70s.

CORONAVIRUS IS SPREADING FASTEST IN NORTH EAST AND SLOWEST IN LONDON The coronavirus is infecting people twice as fast in the North East of England as it is in London, data shows. Research by Public Health England and Cambridge University suggests the crucial reproduction rate, known as the R, is just 0.4 in the capital. However in the North East and Yorkshire, the R - which simply denotes the average number of people each COVID-19 patient infects - is thought to be hovering at around 0.8. It is vital that this number - which is thought to have been between 3.5 and 4 at the start of the crisis - stays below 1, otherwise the outbreak will start to rapidly spiral again as people infect others around them at a faster rate. London was formerly the UK's coronavirus epicentre and at least two million people are thought to have been infected there, according to estimates. But the experts say around 15 per cent of residents in the capital have now had the disease already and have built up immunity, which makes it harder for the virus to spread and may explain its low R rate of 0.4. More white collar jobs in London meant more employees were able to work from home and isolate from others, which also stunts COVID-19's ability to infect people, epidemiologists say. The real-time tracking of the R rate is the latest piece of evidence that northern towns are now bearing the brunt of the crisis after the virus was shut out of the capital. In the Midlands, the value is believed to be 0.68, but in the South West it is thought to be around 0.76. The PHE and Cambridge researchers say the R is 0.71 in the East of England, 0.73 in the North West and 0.71 in the South East. The scientists drew from data from death certificates, as well as NHS and PHE coronavirus test results to predict the reproduction number but exactly how they came to their results is unclear.

Government officials say each person who is infected will pass on the virus to between 0.5 and 0.9 other people, showing that its reproduction rate - the R - is below one, so the outbreak is shrinking.

Research by the University of Cambridge and Public Health England suggests the rates of spread vary across the country, slowing to 0.4 in London and speeding up to around 0.8 in the North East. As long as it can be kept below one and the number of cases is low it should be safe to begin to ease lockdown.

The 33 people who tested positive in the ONS survey came from 30 different households, suggesting they either lived alone or most had managed not to infect the people they lived with. It is not known whether they realised they were ill before they got tested.

The same 5,276 households will be tested regularly to watch how the numbers change, and the scheme will be expanded to 10,000 homes in which everyone over the age of two will be asked to take part in swab testing.

If everyone in the country was able to be tested it could be expected that between one in every 250 and one in every 588 people would test positive. It is impossible to be certain because the sample size is small.

'Our latest estimates indicate,' the ONS report said, 'that at any given time during the two weeks from 27 April to 10 May 2020, an average of 148,000 people in England had the coronavirus (COVID-19).'

It added: 'All estimates are subject to uncertainty, given that a sample is only a subset representation of the wider population. However, confidence intervals provide us with a range of values that we believe contain the unknown true number of cases testing positive for COVID-19 infection.

'While we estimate that 148,000 people in England would test positive, if we repeated this study many times, 95 per cent of the time the true number of positives would lie between 94,000 and 222,000. This equates to between 0.17 per cent and 0.41 per cent of the target population.'

The figures come as a study from the University of Manchester today claimed nearly one in three Britons has already been infected with the coronavirus.

The first scientific study to analyse case rates at local levels estimated 29 per cent of the UK population had already had the illness by April 19, just 10 days after the peak of fatalities in NHS hospitals.

The academics who led the research said the finding confirms that the majority of sufferers have mild or no symptoms, and are unaware they have been infected.

They calculated rates of infection across the country by using local data and comparing the number of officially diagnosed cases over rolling 10-day periods.

Comparing five days' worth of cases before a date and then the five days after that date gave the scientists an idea of how widely the virus was spreading, they said, and they compared this to the changeable reproduction rate.

They came up with an estimate that there were 237 unrecorded COVID-19 cases for every one that was diagnosed, and then applied this to the 73,000 official cases by April 19, suggesting more than 17million people were infected.

The analysis suggested unreported community infection was more than 200 times higher than official Government figures. This will have reduced since then because the outbreak is now much slower.

But the scientists say the fact a quarter of Britons may already be immune to the illness provides 'light at the end of the tunnel' for coming out of lockdown.

Experts believe that at least half the population - potentially around 60 per cent - will need to have recovered from the virus for herd immunity to start to take effect, in which people would be protected by the fact that the virus cannot spread through people who have had it already.

Office for National Statistics data suggests there is no significant difference between infection rates across age groups. It is impossible to draw definitive conclusions, however, because only 33 people tested positive across all ages combined

Lead researcher Dr Adrian Heald, of The University of Manchester, said: 'COVID-19 is a highly infectious condition. It is very dangerous for a small group of people.

HALF OF BRITONS THINK NORMALITY IS SIX MONTHS AWAY Almost half of Britons now believe it will take at least six months for normal life to resume, data shows. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) quizzed more than 1,300 people about the impact of coronavirus on British society. Results revealed 46 per cent of Britons fear it will take half-a-year before life returns to what it was before the pandemic struck. In contrast, the rate was just 33 per cent among a sample of Brits asked the same question in the week after lockdown was announced on March 23. The data, published today, also revealed three quarters of Britons are worried about the impact COVID-19 was having on their life. And it found eight in ten Brits abided by the government's rules to only leave their home for one form of exercise, medical reasons, shopping, or to work (if they were a key worker).

'However a much larger group seem to have low or no symptoms and have been unreported. This study tries to provide an estimate of the number of historic infections and gives us all a glimmer of hope that there may be light at the end of the tunnel.

'We show how effective social distancing and lockdown has been. Though this is a tragedy, it could have been far worse.'

The researchers made their estimate after analysing published local authority data in 144 regions in the UK.

This enabled them to calculate the R-value - the average number of people each COVID-19 patient infects - within each local authority area.

They believe each COVID-19 patient infected 2.8 others before the country went into lockdown on March 23.

But they say the reproduction number is now 0.9 or below in every corner of the country thanks to social distancing and the natural consequences of cumulative community infection.

It is vital that this number stays below 1, otherwise the outbreak will start to rapidly spiral again as people infect others around them at a faster rate.

The study, published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice, was carried out by a team from the University of Manchester, Salford Royal Hospital and analytics company Res Consortium.

Dr Heald, who is also a consultant at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, added: 'We also demonstrate that like any virus, COVID-19 has taken its natural course and infected a significant percentage of the UK population.

'The more people that are exposed to this - or any - virus, the less easy it is for further transmission to occur.

'Government policy can only moderate the impact using measures like widespread testing, social distancing and personal protective equipment.

'The social and economic impacts of Lockdown have been very difficult. But we believe this analysis may aid policy makers in a smoother transition to reducing social containment and sustainably managing the COVID-19 disease.'

ONLY 4.4% OF FRENCH POPULATION INFECTED A mere 4.4 per cent of the French population - or 2.8 million people - have been infected by coronavirus, a study led by the Pasteur Institute says. Published on Wednesday in the journal Science, researchers say the infection rate in the worst-hit parts of France - the eastern part of the country and the Paris region - is between 9 and 10 per cent on average. 'Around 65 per cent of the population should be immune if we want to control the pandemic by the sole means of immunity', the study says. The rate of infection was measured by the Pasteur Institute as of May 11, the day when France started to unwind its almost two-month-long national lockdown. 'As of a consequence, our results show that, without a vaccine, the herd immunity alone will not be enough to avoid a second wave at the end of the lockdown. Efficient control measures must thus be upheld after May 11', researchers say. Herd immunity refers to a situation where enough people in a population have immunity to an infection to be able to effectively stop that disease from spreading. France's overall death toll from the virus rose to 27,074 on Wednesday, the fifth-highest in the world, and total number of cases officially stood at 177,700, the seventh-highest total. The Pasteur Institute also said the lockdown put in place on March 17 in France led to a drastic decline of the coronavirus' reproduction rate, going from 2.9 to 0.67 over the 55-day virtual standstill of the country. A Spanish study also published on Wednesday showed similar results, saying about 5 per cent of the country's population had contracted the disease and that there was no herd immunity in Spain, also emerging progressively for long lockdown.

Dr Heald added: 'This will allow policy makers to avoid a 'one size fits all' approach to pandemic policy.

'That does not consider the variation in both infection rates and impact across localities.'

Mike Stedman, from Res Consortium, said: 'Using our experience working with the NHS on improving patient services, we conducted this work in our own time.

'We felt we could make a valuable contribution to the public and policy makers by calculating the progression in the local and national daily infection rate.

'The figures are not perfect, with the numbers of severely ill patients as a proportion of the total cases being used as a market for estimates of wider infection.

'Only extensive antibody testing could give us a more accurate picture. But as that is only just becoming available, we believe this form of modelling is important in informing the best approach to unlocking the population.'

Dr Heald and Mike Stedman argue that incremental lifting of current social restrictions as soon as possible is vital to minimise further damage to the economy and the impact of prolonged social containment.

However, they add, this must be balanced against containing the current pandemic and minimising future waves of infection.

Dr Adam Kucharski, a professor in infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: 'Given how difficult it is to estimate the extent of unreported cases in a population from reported cases alone, it is likely that there is huge uncertainty in the estimates produced by the model used in this paper, and unfortunately this uncertainty is not reflected in the single value quoted in the paper and the press release.

'In addition, we now have direct measurements of infection from antibody testing in several countries, and the values found are generally much lower than the one suggested by this modelling analysis.

'One recent study found 5 per cent had antibodies in Spain overall, another estimated 2 per cent in Luxembourg, another 10 per cent in Geneva.

'Even in areas that have been severely affected by COVID-19, the proportion of the population with evidence of past infection is so far relatively low: 10 per cent in Wuhan, 10 per cent in London, 11 per cent in Madrid, 14 per cent in Gangelt, Germany; 21 per cent in New York.

'The only serological study the authors cite is a study from Santa Clara, California, which has received substantial criticism for likely overestimating the actual extent of infection in the population.

'Given how much antibody data is now emerging, it is increasingly important to focus on measurements rather than just modelling estimates.'

Understanding the number of people who have had the virus in the past can tell scientists more about how deadly it truly is.

Currently, the death rate is unknown because researchers can only compare the numbers of deaths with the number of hospital patients, which will show it to be unrealistically high.

A scientist has warned that around 560,000 people could die from coronavirus if half of Britain gets infected, a leading scientist has warned after results from the government antibody surveillance scheme suggested the virus kills 1.7 per cent of all cases.

Sir Patrick Vallance, Number 10's chief scientific adviser, revealed recently that around four per cent of Britain and 10 per cent of London has developed antibodies against COVID-19.

The estimate - based on data from antibody testing across the home nations carried out a fortnight ago - means only around 2.64million Brits have had the infection. It also suggests the illness kills around 1.21 per cent of all cases, making it around 12 times deadlier than the flu.

However, the infection fatality rate could be even higher, when the thousands of the UK's hidden COVID-19 deaths are included in the tally. Estimates on backdated data from the Office for National Statistics suggest at least 45,550 Britons have actually died - a death rate of around 1.73 per cent.

Infectious disease expert Professor Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline that based on the predicted death rate of 1.7 per cent, the disease could cause up to 560,000 deaths in the UK, if half of the population was infected.

Other global antibody surveillance samples suggest the coronavirus death rate is much lower, between 0.3 and 0.75 per cent of cases. Those studies suggest between six and 12million people have caught the virus in the UK.

Professor Matt Keeling a populations and disease expert at the University of Warwick, said the British data would currently give a 'gross over-estimate of the fatality rate' because it was from so long ago - it was taken before mid-April and would likely only have diagnosed people who were ill weeks before that.

Ministers launched surveillance studies to track the rate of COVID-19 in Britain, with the true size of the outbreak remaining a mystery. Millions of cases have been missed because health chiefs controversially decided to abandon widespread testing early on in the outbreak.

Preliminary data from a separate government surveillance system released in Boris Johnson's 50-page exit plan yesterday suggested that almost 140,000 people in England currently have the coronavirus.

It comes as other official data released by the Office for National Statistics today show almost 10,000 care home residents have now died of coronavirus in Britain, accounting for a quarter of all the country's victims.

Death rate continues to drop: UK announces 428 more coronavirus deaths taking Britain's total official figure to 33,614

Britain's daily COVID-19 death toll dropped again today as the outbreak continues to slow, as officials announced 428 more victims - the lowest jump on a Thursday since the end of March.

Official figures released by the Department of Health show 33,614 coronavirus patients have now died across all settings in the UK, including hospitals and care homes, since the crisis began.

But the count is known to be inaccurate because it only takes into account lab-confirmed cases. Separate figures suggest Britain's real death toll - already the highest in Europe - could be in the region of 50,000.

Health chiefs also revealed a further 3,446 Britons have tested positive for COVID-19, meaning the official number of cases recorded in the UK has topped 233,000 - but the real size is also a mystery.

Ministers have no idea about how many people have been struck down since the outbreak began because of the controversial decision to abandon mass-testing before it spiralled out of control.

More than 2,000 people have now died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, Nicola Sturgeon said at her daily briefing, with 34 more announced from the past 24 hours.

Public Health Wales announced a further 10 deaths, totalling 1,164 in the country, and Northern Ireland a further five, equalling 454.

The remaining 379 deaths occurred in England, which include all settings. NHS England announced 207 deaths from hospitals.

Patients were aged between 33 and 100 years old. Six patients, aged between 35 and 95 years old had no known underlying health condition, meaning they were considered healthy before the virus.

Deaths have been very slowly falling over the past few weeks since the peak struck in mid-April, with fewer fatalities reported in hospitals and care homes every day.

The Government death tally only counts people who have tested positive but has been rationing tests for months.

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes everyone who has COVID-19 mentioned on their death certificate, regardless of whether they were tested for it.

Figures suggests the true number of coronavirus victims in Britain is likely over 44,000 and almost 40 per cent higher than the Department of Health's statistics show.

At least 50,000 more people than usual have died in Britain since the coronavirus outbreak began, statistics show, known as 'excess deaths'.

They take into account not just people who have died of COVID-19 but also those who died without a doctor ever noticing they had the virus, people who died as a result of hospital disruptions, and those who died because of indirect effects of the outbreak.

Office for National Statistics data showed yesterday that 8,315 people have died in care homes in England and Wales with coronavirus listed on their death certificate. But researchers at the London School of Economics suggest this is only around 41 per cent of the total, which could be more like 22,000

ONS has recorded 45,777 more deaths than normal since the beginning of March in England and Wales. Adding data from Scotland and Northern Ireland pushes this total to 50,979, the Financial Times reported.

The backdated ONS data shows almost 10,000 care home residents have died of coronavirus in Britain, accounting for a quarter of all the country's victims.

Researchers at the London School of Economics suggest care home deaths could be more in the region of 22,000.

The care home scandal continues to flare as politicians rally and question the Government's response to the outbreak in the early days.

Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt today condemned the failure to deploy coronavirus tests on patients discharged into care homes.

He insisted checks on patients sent back to care homes was an obvious 'thing that needed to happen'.

The criticism came after an row between Labour's Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson which started at PMQs yesterday.

Sir Keir ambushed Mr Johnson by quoting official guidance that had been in place until March 12 – well after coronavirus had started being transmitted in the UK - that said it was 'very unlikely' care home residents would become infected with Covid-19.

Mr Johnson accused the opposition leader of 'selectively and misleadingly' citing the document after the bruising exchange.

The document published at the end of February did state it was not likely there would be infections in care homes because, at that stage, there was no evidence of community transmission.

The advice was withdrawn on March 13, by which time there had been 31 coronavirus-related deaths in England, including one in a care home, according to the ONS.

The issue continues to fall back to caps on testing. NHS chiefs have revealed that it was only on April 15 - after the UK outbreak peaked - that enough capacity was in place to test 'systematically' everyone discharged from hospital.

Although they say only a 'very small number' of asymptomatic patients would have been sent to social care without being checked, the error has been likened to taking death straight into care homes where extremely vulnerable people live.

A Cabinet minister acknowledged the coronavirus crisis in care homes was 'absolutely terrible'.

Ministers have no idea about how many people have been struck down since the outbreak began because of the controversial decision to abandon mass-testing before it spiralled out of control.

But the results of a pilot study today show an average of 148,000 people in England had coronavirus at any given time between April 27 and May 10 - 0.27 per cent of the population.

The virus is not spreading as quick in London as it is in the North East of England, scientists have warned. The R number - deemed crucial to suppressing the outbreak - is twice as low in the capital (0.4).

APRIL QUIETEST MONTH FOR A&E AS PATIENTS 'AVOID HOSPITALS' April was the quietest month ever for A&E departments across England, NHS statistics have revealed. Only 916,581 emergency department visits were recorded in the month that Britain's coronavirus crisis peaked - the first time on record the number has dipped below one million. The number of times people sought emergency help fell by more than half in just two months as COVID-19 gripped the nation. People have been avoiding hospitals out of fear of adding extra pressure to the NHS or catching the virus while they're in the hospital, doctors say. Medics warn the massive change in behaviour is a 'ticking time bomb' which may result in more people ending up seriously ill or dying in the near future because they avoided getting medical help when they needed it. There are also concerns that people with cancer will be delayed casualties of the crisis, with urgent referrals for treatment for the disease down eight per cent on last year. Some 181,873 urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in March 2020, down from 198,418 in March 2019. Urgent breast cancer referrals showed a bigger drop – down from 17,137 in March 2019 to 12,411 in March 2020, a fall of 28 per cent. NHS England, which published the figures, said the falls were 'likely to be a result of the COVID-19 response' – an indication that people have been staying away from A&E departments because of the coronavirus outbreak. The number of people being admitted to hospital beds through A&E also fell sharply last month, down 39 per cent from 535,226 in April 2019 to 326,581 in April 2020. This is the lowest number reported for any calendar month since current records began. Advertisement

It is the number of people in the UK who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for Covid-19. It is based on the number of deaths reported to the Department of Health & Social Care by the four nations of the UK, regardless of when the deaths took place. The day-on-day change in this number is not a measure of how many deaths have occurred in the previous 24 hours, but instead the number of deaths reported since the previous total was announced. Deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the UK Current total: 38,773 This is the number of deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on death certificate, including suspected cases. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show 35,044 deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in England and Wales up to May 1 (and had been registered up to May 9). The latest figures from the National Records of Scotland showed 3,213 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in Scotland up to May 10. The latest figures from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, also published last week, showed 516 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in Northern Ireland up to May 1, including those registered up to and including May 6. Together these figures mean that so far 38,773 Covid-19 deaths have been registered across the UK. Excess deaths in the UK for the period of the pandemic Current total: over 50,000 The latest figures from the ONS show that 108,345 deaths were registered in England and Wales between March 21 and May 1. This was 46,494 more than the average for this period in the previous five years. Of these excess deaths, Covid-19 was responsible for 33,257, or 71.5 per cent. The remainder - excess deaths not linked with Covid-19 - might have been caused by factors connected with wider changes since the lockdown began: a reluctance by some people to visit a doctor or a hospital, for instance, or the result of long-term health conditions being made worse by having to remain at home.

Meanwhile a Government testing survey suggests up to 222,000 people in England may be infected with the coronavirus right now.

The survey, of which this is the first set of data, will be ongoing as part of the Government's 'test, track and trace' plan for getting out of lockdown.

The first round of random tests of 10,000 members of the public has identified only 33 positive cases of COVID-19 - an estimated national infection rate of 0.27 per cent. This suggests that 148,000 people had the virus at any given time between April 27 and May 10, with the estimate ranging from 94,000 to 222,000.

The 33 people who tested positive came from 30 different households, suggesting they either lived alone or most had managed not to infect the people they lived with. It is not known whether the people had realised they were ill before they were tested.

Numbers announced today did not include anyone who was tested in a care home or a hospital, where the statisticians said 'rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be higher'.

During the time period of the study, 66,343 people were officially diagnosed.

The rate of infection is six times higher in healthcare workers and carers than it is in the general population. In patient-facing healthcare and resident-facing social care roles, 1.33 per cent tested positive for Covid-19.

It comes as the World Health Organisation regional director for Europe Dr Hans Kluge warned the UK was one of the top 10 countries reporting consistently high coronavirus cases over 24 hours.

During a virtual briefing, he said: 'Across the European region we're seeing an overall slowing of the pandemic. But this remains a time of sorrow for many.'

Research published today shows the coronavirus is infecting people twice as fast in the North East of England than it is in London.

Public Health England and Cambridge University found crucial reproduction rate, known as the R, is just 0.4 in the capital.

But in the North East and Yorkshire, the R - the average number of people each COVID-19 patient infects - is thought to be hovering at around 0.8.

In the Midlands, the value is believed to be 0.68, but in the South West it is thought to be around 0.76. The R is 0.71 in the East of England, 0.73 in the North West and 0.71 in the South East.

It is vital the R number - which is thought to have been between 3.5 and 4 at the start of the crisis - stays below 1, otherwise the outbreak will start to rapidly spiral again as people infect others around them at a faster rate.

London was formerly the UK's coronavirus epicentre and at least two million people are thought to have been infected there, according to estimates.

But yesterday, it was revealed that eight out of 10 of areas with the highest infection rates in Britain right now are in northern parts of England.

The small industrial town of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, has an infection rate of 882 cases per 100,000 - almost double that in Brent (419), the worst-hit part of London.

Barrow's infection rate is more than double that of Wales (365), triple England's (244) and Scotland's (251) and quadruple the rate recorded in Northern Ireland (220).

Experts say the lower R in London may be because there are more white collar jobs in London, therefore more employees were able to work from home and isolate from others.

Or it could be because around 15 per cent of residents in the capital have now had the disease already and have built up immunity, which would slows the spread of the virus.

The coronavirus is infecting people twice as fast in the North East of England than it is in London, real-time tracking of the reproductive 'R' rating shows

Official figures show at least 552 people in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, have caught COVID-19 since the outbreak began in February. That gives the small industrial town of 67,000 people a rate of 882 cases per 100,000 - or 0.88 per cent - more than double that of Wales (365), triple England's (244) and Scotland's (251) and quadruple the rate recorded in Northern Ireland (220)

SADIQ KHAN ACCUSED OF BLACKMAILING FOR £2BLN BAILOUT Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has been accused of blackmailing Boris Johnson after threatening to cut Tube, train and bus services unless the PM agrees an emergency bailout of £2billion by the end of today. Mr Khan has claimed that Transport for London will go bust unless the Government hands over cash to fill the £4billion black hole coronavirus has left in its finances because of an 80 per cent plunge in income from fares, advertising and the congestion charge. TfL was already losing millions each month before the coronavirus and is billions in debt after Mr Khan's decision to freeze fares every year since he was elected in 2020. He has also been accused of being too soft on militant transport unions and having the worst average strikes record of any Mayor. Industry sources have claimed TfL is losing £600million a month during the crisis and wants £2billion in taxpayer-funded support even though bosses have £1.2billion in their cash reserves. Mr Khan told LBC: 'Being blunt, today is the last day. Unless the government today gives us confirmation of the grant that we need, the consequences could be quite severe and the implications for all of us will be huge. The only way to balance the books is to cut services'. Former Tory minister Stephen Hammond, MP for Wimbledon, told MailOnline: 'An extraordinary remark. He is threatening the health of Londoners by saying this sort of thing. We need to get the networks, the Tube and the London suburban network back up to full capacity. the mayor should concentrate on running as big a service as possible so people can travel socially distanced and in as responsible a way as possible.’

It supports preliminary data from the Government run study, which suggests around 10 per cent of Londoners have tested positive for antibodies.

This means around 900,000 people in the capital have developed some form of immunity to the virus.

Around 8,000 people are estimated to have died in London - giving COVID-19 a death rate of 0.89 per cent in London.

In the Downing Street press conference last night, Sir Patrick Vallance said overall the rate of people who have antibodies across the whole of Britain is around 4 per cent.

Sir Patrick Vallance has previously said around 60 per cent of the population need to catch the virus to build up a national tolerance to curb the spread.

It comes as health chiefs finally announced they had found a reliable antibody test after several weeks of hunting for one.

Plans to roll-out the game-changing kits flopped after ministers couldn't find a test good enough - but Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche's has reportedly passed the test.

Experts are hopeful these people could be immune from catching the infection again for up to three years. But currently, the evidence on how long immunity lasts is not clear.

Ministers are now in talks with Roche to buy millions of the kits, which officials today announced would be given to NHS and social care workers first before being rolled out more widely.

Questions were today asked about why it took Public Health England so long to approve the test - 10 days after US regulators gave the 'game-changing' kit the green light.

One top scientist admitting it took 'longer than it should' and another warning 'every day counts' during a pandemic.

Meanwhile, on Britain's second day 'back to work', there were more grim scenes on the Tube and buses this morning as people crammed onto limited services.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan (pictured in Downing Street in March) has launched an extraordinary attack on Boris Johnson and also warned he will cut Tube, train and bus services unless the PM agrees an emergency bailout by the end of today

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has finally announced that he will increase Tube services in London to 75 per cent of normal on Monday.

But he has been accused of blackmailing Boris Johnson after threatening to cut Tube, train and bus services unless the PM agrees an emergency bailout of £2billion by the end of today.

Mr Khan told LBC: 'Being blunt, today is the last day. Unless the government today gives us confirmation of the grant that we need, the consequences could be quite severe and the implications for all of us will be huge. The only way to balance the books is to cut services'.

'We need to get the networks, the Tube and the London suburban network back up to full capacity. the mayor should concentrate on running as big a service as possible so people can travel socially distanced and in as responsible a way as possible.’

There has also been anger over Mr Khan's comments on LBC this morning, with one listener saying: 'He is trying to blackmail the government and yes he is prepared to use the health and safety of London’s key workers as collateral for a bailout of his transport service', while another critic tweeted: 'It's blackmail - just as people start to return to work'.

Last August there were a record 4.41million patients in England on waiting lists for routine operations, a rise of 250,000 from the same month a year earlier.

But that number is expected to more than double because of a backlog triggered by the COVD-19 crisis, according to the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think-tank.

When officials realised the coronavirus was spreading out of control in the UK they urged hospitals to cancel as many operations as they could and turf out patients on their wards to make way for a surge in COVID-19 patients.

The move was successful and hospitals were not overwhelmed by the effects of the virus but hundreds of thousands of patients have had treatment delayed as a result.

Nigel Edwards, the Nuffield Trust CEO, said hospitals have only been able to carry out around '15 to 20 per cent' of elective procedures, meaning up to 1.3million patients are missing out every month.

Even after the NHS gets back up and running after the crisis, social distancing measures, a lack of PPE and new cleaning regimes will slow down the health service further, Mr Edwards said.

It makes it 'very likely we will have doubled the waiting list to over eight million by the late autumn', with one in eight people waiting for treatment.

Chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, Nigel Edwards, said more than 8million people will be stuck on NHS waiting lists by autumn. Pictured: Speaking at a virtual House of Commons Health and Social Care Committee meeting today

Speaking at a virtual House of Commons Health and Social Care Committee meeting, Mr Edwards said: 'Between 1.5 and 1.7million people a month start a new care pathway, or at least they did before March.

‘We can already see in the March data, the number of patients starting new pathways or being referred has fallen very significantly.

‘Of course that’s going to be more the case in April and May. Various hospitals I've been speaking to say they’ve been able to do 15, maybe 20 per cent of their elective work.

‘So the maths of that is absolutely brutal. It means between 1.2 and 1.3million people each month, who you’d expect to be starting a pathway, who have not been referred yet... it seems very likely we will have doubled the waiting list to over eight million by the late autumn.’

Mr Edwards's testimony comes on the back of a study which predicted 7.2million people would be on waiting lists by autumn.

The analysis by Medefer, a healthcare provider to the NHS, estimated that 3.5million people will need an outpatient appointment this month as the NHS gets back up and running.

It said the entire health service waiting list in England could reach 7.2million by the end of September.

Chairman of the British Medical Association Dr Chaand Nagpaul said it highlighted the fears of many doctors that non-coronavirus patients were not being properly looked after.

Only 916,581 emergency department visits were recorded in the month that Britain's coronavirus crisis peaked - the first time on record the number has dipped below one million

Even after the NHS gets back up and running after the crisis, social distancing measures, a lack of PPE and new cleaning regimes will slow down the health service further, Mr Edwards said. Pictured: Medics outside Mater Hospital in Belfast join in the applause during the nationwide Clap for Carers

April was the quietest EVER month in A&E as attendances HALVED in two months with 900,000 seeking urgent medical help, official figures show April was the quietest month ever for A&E departments across England, NHS statistics have revealed. Only 916,581 emergency department visits were recorded in the month that Britain's coronavirus crisis peaked - the first time on record the number has dipped below one million. The number of times people sought emergency help fell by more than half in just two months as COVID-19 gripped the nation. People have been avoiding hospitals out of fear of adding extra pressure to the NHS or catching the virus while they're in the hospital, doctors say. Medics warn the massive change in behaviour is a 'ticking time bomb' which may result in more people ending up seriously ill or dying in the near future because they avoided getting medical help when they needed it. There are also concerns that people with cancer will be delayed casualties of the crisis, with urgent referrals for treatment for the disease down eight per cent on last year. NHS England, which published the figures, said the falls were 'likely to be a result of the COVID-19 response' – an indication that people have been staying away from A&E departments because of the coronavirus outbreak. The number of people being admitted to hospital beds through A&E also fell sharply last month, down 39 per cent from 535,226 in April 2019 to 326,581 in April 2020. This is the lowest number reported for any calendar month since current records began. Advertisement

He told The Sunday Times: 'Many ill patients are not getting the care they so desperately need now — and, crucially, risking their conditions getting worse, and with some maybe even dying as a result.'

Professor Derek Alderson from the Royal College of Surgeons of England said that patients who could wait for a month four weeks ago will not be able to endure constant postponement.

Last month medics warned that up to 2,700 cancers were being missed every week as the numbers being referred by doctors for urgent hospital appointments or checks had dropped by 75 per cent.

Professor Karol Sikora, a cancer specialist, had warned that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak could result in 50,000 cancer deaths.

And in April Cancer Research UK figures showed the numbers of patients being referred urgently to hospital with suspicious symptoms has dropped by 75 per cent since the start of the outbreak.

Sarah Woolnough from Cancer Research said: 'They have absolutely plummeted.

'People are really worried about going into a health setting. In a way, it's a measure of the effectiveness of the message, ""Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives"".

'You begin to see the unintended consequences. You've got two problems going on. You've got people not seeking help and screening has been paused. So you're not detecting cancers early in the way you would like to.

'What's so worrying for us is that we spent the past decade saying, 'if you suspect cancer, please seek help'.

Steven McIntosh, from Macmillan Cancer Support, added: ‘There’s really worrying evidence that fewer people are coming forward and getting cancer symptoms diagnosed.

‘If you’ve experienced signs of cancer you must urgently contact your GP.’

Hospitals have been given the order to resume services that came to a stop in March to allow more capacity during the ongoing crisis.

The action led to the postponement of millions of operations. Doctors have said some may have already died due to the drastic measure.

Chief executive of the NHS Confederation, Niall Dickson, said that resuming services would not simply be a matter of returning to normal - and could be 'more complex and challenging' than preparing the NHS for the coronavirus outbreak.",15,Low,Right
102,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8318537/How-crucial-coronavirus-R-rate-varies-England.html,Daily Mail,2020-05-14,['Connor Boyd'],How the crucial coronavirus 'R' rate varies across England,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/14/11/28383060-0-image-a-17_1589451915190.jpg,"The coronavirus is infecting people twice as fast in the North East of England than it is in London, data shows.

Research by Public Health England and Cambridge University suggests the crucial reproduction rate, known as the R, is just 0.4 in the capital.

In the North East and Yorkshire, the R - the average number of people each COVID-19 patient infects - is thought to be hovering at around 0.8.

It is vital that this number - which is thought to have been between 3.5 and 4 at the start of the crisis - stays below 1, otherwise the outbreak will start to rapidly spiral again as people infect others around them at a faster rate.

London was formerly the UK's coronavirus epicentre and at least two million people are thought to have been infected there, according to estimates.

But the experts say around 15 per cent of residents in the capital have now had the disease already and have built up immunity, which makes it harder for the virus to spread and may explain its low R rate of 0.4.

More white collar jobs in London meant more employees were able to work from home and isolate from others, which also stunts COVID-19's ability to infect people, epidemiologists say.

The real-time tracking of the R rate is the latest piece of evidence that northern towns are now bearing the brunt of the crisis after the virus was shut out of the capital.

Yesterday, it was revealed that eight out of 10 of areas with the highest infection rates in Britain are in northern parts of England.

The small industrial town of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, has an infection rate of 882 cases per 100,000 - almost double that in Brent (419), the worst-hit part of London.

The coronavirus is infecting people twice as fast in the North East of England than it is in London, real-time tracking of the reproductive 'R' rating shows

How the 'R' has fallen since lockdown: The reproduction number (shown on the vertical axis) was over 3.5 in the North East and Yorkshire, but has fallen to 0.8 now. In the North West, it was believed to be just below 3.5 at its peak but has now dropped to 0.73

If the R rate rises above one Britain's outbreak will start to grow again after weeks of shrinking. A rate of 0.5, for example, would mean every 10 infected people pass it on to only five others, while a rate of 1.2 would see them give it to 12

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted that keeping the R below 1 is the most important of five tests that must be passed before returning to normal life.

The R is used to measure how fast the disease is spreading, and if it rises above 1, cases would start to grow rapidly and the virus could spiral out of control.

The latest research suggests the R is below 1 in all corners of England, but there is variation between regions.

In the Midlands, the value is believed to be 0.68, but in the South West it is thought to be around 0.76.

The PHE and Cambridge researchers say the R is 0.71 in the East of England, 0.73 in the North West and 0.71 in the South East.

The scientists drew from data from death certificates, as well as NHS and PHE coronavirus test results to predict the reproduction number.

But exactly how they came to their results is unclear, according to infectious disease expert Professor Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia.

He told MailOnline it was possible the researchers were 'using a model previously designed for influenza', which could make the results 'uncertain'.

The PHE and Cambridge researchers estimate the R was just below 3 in London and the Midlands at its peak

In the South East and South West, the R was below 3 at the highest point - but it is now believed to be hovering at around 0.7

For the East of England, the reproduction value surpassed 3 at its peak but has dropped to 0.71, the researchers say. For the entire country, the R is believed to be 0.75, on average

WHAT IS THE R NUMBER? Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought' - or simply R. It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect if the virus is reproducing in its ideal conditions. Most epidemiologists - scientists who track disease outbreaks - believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has an R value of around 3. But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark. As an outbreak goes on, the R0 may be referred to more accurately as Re or just R, as other factors come into play to influence how well it is able to spread. Estimates of the COVID-19 R vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment. As an outbreak progress the R may simply be referred to as R, which means the effective rate of infection - the nought works on the premise that nobody in the population is protected, which becomes outdated as more people recover.

The Government is doing its own monitoring of R values in the country to help it decide when to end lockdown.

But officials have been accused of not being transparent because they have yet to release regional breakdowns.

Mayors in the North West of England have written to Boris Johnson demanding he make them public.

Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram said their regions had 'the highest number of new cases last week' and questioned if the easing of lockdown had come too soon for the Greater Manchester and Liverpool City.

Mr Burnham and Mr Rotheram wrote to the PM on Tuesday to say data on the R number needed to be published at a regional and sub-regional level on a daily basis 'as a matter of urgency', according to the BBC.

'We believe this is essential information which will help our residents make informed decisions about the risk and help decide whether they wish to take a more cautious approach to the relaxation of the lockdown rules, given the risk locally', they wrote.

Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline it was still 'too early' to draw any conclusions from the Cambridge University findings.

He said: 'The level is below one as a result of the lockdown, put simply if you don't bump into anyone, you cannot pass on the virus, even if you have it.

'Evidently adherence to social distancing is not the same everywhere, or at least did not get taken seriously everywhere at the same time, and you've also got to factor in the relative level of susceptible people.

'The key point limiting opening up is that the virus has not changed, it's not weaker or less infectious so we are, in a way, back at a similar point to the beginning of the epidemic.

'What's changed is that everyone is now aware of the situation and most people treat it seriously, so as long as that remains the case the numbers could now be kept under control.

'There may also be some additional side factors such as warmer weather, mask use etc which will all have a percentage effect. But exactly how the R number will develop as lockdown eases is unknown.'

Some scientists and senior ministers have warned the Government against relying too heavily on the R value because it is being 'skewed upwards' by care homes.

Greg Clark MP, the chairman of the science and technology select committee, said the R value was 'irrelevant'.

He told The Telegraph: 'There's a concern that measures that could safely release people back into the community are not being taken because of an irrelevant 'R' number determined by cases in care homes and hospitals.

'It's not clear how the 'R rate in care homes is relevant to the 'R' rates of people going about their daily business. If people are in a care home, by definition they are not going out into the community and infecting other people.

'But the single 'R' number given out by the Government has been skewed. It cannot reflect the reality outside, and we need to know whether crucial public policy decisions are being based on this number.'

Epidemiologist Mark Woolhouse, a professor at the University of Edinburgh and an adviser to Tony Blair's Government during the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, described the R as a 'very, very crude number' which was too general to use by itself to decide on policy.

He told the paper he was 'very against' using it as a policy objective in anyway and would be 'unhappy' if it was the deciding factor for lockdown.

It comes after Government data revealed northern towns were now being hit hardest by the coronavirus.

At least 552 people in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, have caught COVID-19 since the outbreak began in February, according to the latest Government data.

At least 552 people in Barrow-in-Furness (pictured), Cumbria, have been infected with the disease since the outbreak began in February

That gives the small industrial town of 67,000 people, tucked away on the Furness peninsula in the North West, a rate of 882 cases per 100,000 - or 0.88 per cent.

To put this into perspective, Barrow's infection rate is more than double that of Wales (365), triple England's (244) and Scotland's (251) and quadruple the rate recorded in Northern Ireland (220).

Figures show that Cumbria is also home to the area with the third highest infection rate. South Lakeland - east of Barrow-in-Furness - has a rate of 488 cases per 100,000 people.

And the town with the second-highest rate is Lancaster (753), which is located on the other side of Morecambe Bay in Lancashire.

Experts are puzzled as to why this part of the North West has turned into a hotspot for COVID-19 but local public health officials say it may be skewed by higher testing figures.

The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trust (UHMBT) covers three hospitals treating coronavirus patients - the Furness general in Barrow, the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and the Westmorland general in Kendal in South Lakeland. The trust has recorded 156 deaths, according to NHS England statistics.

Colin Cox, the director of public health for Cumbria, claims the NHS trust began mass-testing its employees and patients at the end of February and has conducted 'three times' more swabs on average, which 'may explain a fair chunk of it'.

That gives the small industrial town of 67,000 people, tucked away on the on the Furness peninsula in the North West, a rate of 882 cases per 100,000

WHICH AREAS HAVE THE HIGHEST COVID-19 INFECTION RATES PER 100,000 PEOPLE? Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria ( 822) Lancaster, Lancashire (522) South Lakeland, Cumbria (488) Ashford, Kent (484) Gateshead, Tyne and Wear (478) Sunderland (478) South Tyneside, Tyne and Wear (448) Middlesbrough (447) Carlisle (431) Brent, London (429) ...AND WHICH AREAS HAVE THE LOWEST COVID-19 INFECTION RATES PER 100,000 PEOPLE?

A total 61 people in Barrow have fallen victim to coronavirus, giving it a death rate of 91 for every 100,000 – one of the worst outside of London.

Officials are stumped as to why the town has been plagued with so many cases, despite welcoming just a fraction of the tourists compared to the nearby Lake District.

Lee Roberts, deputy leader of Barrow borough council, said the figures were a 'big worry' given that lockdown measures are being relaxed today.

Some of the cases can be traced back to a 'super-spreader' house party before lockdown in March, where at least six people had the virus.

The first person to die from the illness in the town had been at the party, according to The Guardian. But how the disease managed to race around the town and infect hundreds more remains a mystery.

Mr Roberts believes high levels of deprivation are partly to blame for the high infection rate.

An Office for National Statistics (ONS) report this month revealed that people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying at twice the rate of those in the wealthiest regions.

Experts say this is because they are exposed to the virus more because they are more likely to work in jobs that cannot be done from home, live in overcrowded homes and use public transport more.

The poorest in society are also more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions and have compromised immune systems - putting them at an increased risk of falling badly unwell with coronavirus.

COVID-19 testing has been largely reserved only for those who fall seriously ill, with those who have minor symptoms being instead told to isolate at home and wait to get better.

Mr Roberts said: 'Most of Barrow is very compact: 40 to 50 per cent of Barrow is terraced housing and we've got a lot of flats, we've got a lot of deprivation, a lot of health inequalities.'

Figures show that Barrow has high levels of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with the national average – both of which make COVID-19 symptoms worse.

'We have quite a lot of historic respiratory problems from people who worked in old industry, in the ship yards,' Mr Roberts added.

And the constituency has higher than average numbers of patients with diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, which are all risk factors for the disease.

Barrow's population is also older than average, with 22.7 per cent of residents aged 65 to 90, compared with the England average of 18.3 per cent.

Coronavirus preys on the elderly, with over-80s 12 times more likely to fall critically ill after catching it, according to some estimates.

But Colin Cox, the director of public health for Cumbria, said the high infection rate may also be skewed by the fact Barrow is testing more people for the virus than other towns.

He told The Guardian: 'The rate of testing in Barrow has been two to three times higher than in many other parts of the north-west, so that will explain a fair chunk of it, but I don't think it will explain all of it.'

How Britain's R number plummeted when the lockdown was introduced and what it means for emerging from the other side

Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week put detailed science at the heart of Britain's coronavirus crisis and said the status of the lockdown now depends on the virus's reproduction number - known as the R.

Watching the number of new patients and the rate at which it goes up or down will be the best way officials can monitor how quickly the virus is spreading, which will in turn guide which risks the Government feels it can take in lifting lockdown.

The data that lays out Britain's R value will shape the lives of everyone in the UK over the coming weeks and months, and MailOnline here explains how:

What is the R number?

Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought' - or simply R.

It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect if the virus is reproducing in its ideal conditions.

Most epidemiologists - scientists who track disease outbreaks - believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has an R value of around 3.

But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark.

As an outbreak goes on, the R0 may be referred to more accurately as Re or just R, as other factors come into play to influence how well it is able to spread.

Estimates of the COVID-19 R vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment.

As an outbreak progress the R may simply be referred to as R, which means the effective rate of infection - the nought works on the premise that nobody in the population is protected, which becomes outdated as more people recover.

How does the reproductive rate compare to other infections?

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be at three times more contagious than the coronavirus that causes MERS (0.3 - 0.8).

Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and has an R0 value of between 12 and 18 if left uncontrolled. Widespread vaccination keeps it suppressed in most developed countries.

Chickenpox's R0 is estimated to be between 10 and 12, but this is controlled in the UK by herd immunity. So many people catch it as children and become immune to reinfection that it is unable to spread among adults.

Seasonal flu has an R value of around 1.5 but it mutates so often - there are often one or more new strains each year - that people cannot develop total immunity to it. Recovering from one strain of flu does not protect someone from others.

Ebola has an R0 of between 1.4 and 1.8 - this is low but it has so far only spread in countries with poor health facilities and its extremely high death rate (50 per cent) makes it a threat.

Mumps has an R0 of between 10 and 12, making it highly infectious, but the measles vaccine (MMR) protects most people in Britain from catching it.

The R0 for whooping cough, known medically as pertussis, is estimated to be 5.5. The NHS urges mothers to have the pertussis vaccine during pregnancy because they are able to pass immunity on to their baby naturally.

How is it calculated? And can scientists ever be sure of the number?

The R is not a set number and scientists calculate it by studying how fast the virus spreads in its perfect environment and also in society.

While the biology of the virus and the way it spreads - whether through coughs or blood, for example - will have some influence, but human behaviour is a bigger factor.

Tracking the rise in numbers of new cases, and how quickly the number of patients is doubling, are two of the best ways to estimate the R, according to senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, and author of the Maths of Life and Death, Dr Kit Yates.

He told MailOnline: 'Most modellers will give uncertainty ranges with their estimates suggesting R could be as high as this or as low as that.

'The R0 is not a fundamental property of the virus. It will change depending on the community through which the disease is passing.

'[It] depends on three factors: the transmissibility (how easily the disease passes between people); the infectious period (the longer it is, the more chances there are for an infectious person to pass on the disease); and the population through which the disease is passing.

'The more people there are and the more densely packed they are the easier it will be for the disease to spread, so we can't just take the R0 measured in one country and use it in another.'

Dr Jennifer Cole, a biological anthropologist at the Royal Holloway university in London said: 'It's incredibly difficult to calculate [the R0] without doing it in retrospect.

She explained that detailed data can show how fast the virus has spread but they are most accurate when you're looking back in time, not at the present day.

'At the moment we don't have exact numbers but we have a rough idea,' Dr Cole added.

'As long as you can say the R0 is between one and two, or between three and four, that's broadly enough to make the decisions you need to on social distancing.'

Did Britain's R number plummet when the lockdown was introduced?

Imperial College London's COVID-19 Response Team estimated the R0 value for the coronavirus was 2.4 in the UK before lockdown started.

This meant that, before Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the national shutdown on March 23, every 10 people who caught the virus would infect 24 others.

But scientists have since calculated that the rate has fallen below 1, meaning the crisis will peter out if the situation stays the same.

London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine researchers said in a paper published at the start of April that they thought the number was 0.62.

They surveyed 1,300 people about their movements and contacts and to judge how many people they were likely to have infected if they were carrying with the virus.

And England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told MPs in a Science and Technology Committee meeting last week the R was between 0.5 and 1.

His counterpart - the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - has also claimed it was at a similar rate, saying it is now between 0.6 and 0.9 across the UK.

In last night's Downing Street press conference, he suggested it was lower in London and added: 'It's not exactly uniform across the country'.

If the number is dropping, why are we still in lockdown?

Substantial drops in the virus's reproduction rate and the number of people infected are vital for the UK to even consider moving out of lockdown.

Number three on the Government's list of five criteria that must be met before lockdown can end is: 'Reliable data to show the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board'.

While Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty say they believe the R is now below one, the Government is, arguably, lacking the 'reliable data' to prove it.

COVID-19 testing had, until last week, been restricted to only hospital patients and medical staff, meaning the true scale of the outbreak was unclear.

Tests are being rolled out more widely now to people who think they might have the virus and also to more than 100,000 random people across the population.

A landmark report published by Imperial College London on March 30 showed politicians in the UK how the virus's reproduction rate could change as the country progressed through lockdown, using models from other countries that had introduced strict social distancing measures earlier (pictured in series). That report came after one by the same team that estimated up to half a million people could die if the Government didn't act, which was credited with persuading Boris Johnson to order the nation to stay at home on March 23

DENMARK'S RATE OF INFECTION ROSE AFTER SCHOOLS REOPENED Authorities in Denmark sent children back to schools two weeks ago and, since then the rate of coronavirus spread has increased, officials say. The country has had a relatively small outbreak, with just 9,356 officially diagnosed cases and 452 deaths. As a result, it has endured a shorter lockdown and already started to ease restrictions. However, the country's infectious diseases agency Status for Smittetrykket I Danmark (SSI), has found that the reproduction rate of the virus has risen to close to 1 - which could trigger another outbreak - since schools were reopened on April 20. It has risen to 0.6 to 0.9 in that time, The Local reported. Research published earlier this week will cause governments to think twice before reopening schools after it revealed that children appear to be just as likely to catch and spread COVID-19 as adults. In its status report the SSI said: 'There is no indication that there is an actual acceleration of the epidemic'.

Officials will now want to see the number of new cases being diagnosed stay low even as they scale up testing, which would show the virus is on its way out. If numbers continue to stay low and even to fall for weeks that would demonstrate the illness is spreading slowly.

Because so few people have had the disease and developed immunity, it is vital that the number of people currently infected drops as low as possible before lockdown lifts, to avoid those patients triggering another outbreak.

Bath's Dr Yates said: 'If the UK relaxes social distancing now, while most of the population is still susceptible, it runs the very real risk of a second wave.

'At the moment suggestions are that R0 might be around 0.7 which means we have a bit of room for manoeuvre in letting up on complete lockdown.

'Provided we keep R0 below 1 then the disease will continue to die out. The reason we are holding on to complete lockdown for so long is because we want to bring cases down to a very low level and the quickest way to do that is to keep R as low as possible.

'To some degree the impact of various different measures is quantifiable and modellers are running through a range of different scenarios in order to advise the government on the best policy.

'But until we actually go through the experiment of lifting the different restrictions we will not really know the effect on R. You can expect a great deal of caution in the measures the government start to relax. Expect it to be conservative initially.'

Movements in Government suggest the lockdown in its current state is likely to continue until June, after Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, yesterday said she thought it would still be too soon for change at next week's three-weekly review, due to be held on May 7.

Professor Whitty did, however, offer a glimmer of hope in a science and technology committee meeting last week when he said the R being below one 'gives a 'little bit of scope for manoeuvre and ticking some things off while still keeping it below 1'.

How will testing 100,000 people track the R value after lockdown?

Sir Patrick Vallance, Britain's chief scientific adviser, yesterday confirmed officials will move forward by using random population testing and numbers of official cases to work out how the R value changes in future.

He said at the Downing Street briefing: 'At the moment we're using a calculated R looking at all sorts of things including contacts, looking at genomics, looking at data from ambulances, hospital admissions, and so on, to calculate the R.'

As part of its three-point 'test, track, trace' plan, at least 25,000 people are being enrolled into a plan to test a sample of the population each month for a year to see if they are currently ill with the virus, tracking it over time.

In a second branch of the tracking project, people in 1,000 households across the country will submit to monthly blood testing to see if they have immunity to the coronavirus from being infected with it in the past.

The Government will also test 100,000 random people in a one-off swab testing scheme, to get an idea of what proportion of the population is infected at present.

Public Health England is carrying out ongoing antibody testing in its Porton Down laboratory to build up an idea of how many people have had the virus in the past and how they have developed immunity to it, and up to 10,000 people will be sent home antibody testing kits to add to this data.

Early results from these nationwide surveys are expected early this month and will help gather a picture of how many people are getting infected with the virus and how fast it's spreading.

The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is also trying to estimate how much the virus is spreading by surveying people about their movements and social contacts in recent days and weeks.

It estimated in April that the R had dropped from 2.6 to 0.62 in the first month of the UK's lockdown.

Will health chiefs publish the R number every day?

Health chiefs have yet to reveal whether they will publish the R number each day, despite the Prime Minister putting the number at the heart of the battle in his speech yesterday.

But ministers in Germany - which has been widely praised for its rigorous approach to halting the outbreak - do provide a daily update.

Situation reports published by the Robert Koch Institute, the country's centre for disease control, show the R0 dropped below one on April 15.

The number fluctuates on a daily basis - it was 0.9 on Tuesday and 0.75 yesterday, meaning it may not be a reliable day-by-day measure, but could be useful to track over time.

Watching the R number as the country comes out of lockdown would be useful because it could reveal exactly how different measures affect the rate of infection.

The lockdown happened all at once but will be lifted piece by piece, meaning calculating how each restriction affects the number cannot truly be known until it is taken away.

Dr Robin Thompson, a mathematical epidemiology researcher at University of Oxford, said: 'A key challenge now is to identify measures that can be relaxed that have only limited impacts on the value of R.

'One of the reasons that this is particularly challenging is that interventions were first introduced in the UK within a few days of each other. As a result, it is hard to disentangle the relative effects of different interventions on the reproduction number.'",15,Low,Right

One in five Britons do not have a phone and therefore won't benefit from the app, according to experts on an ethical panel overseeing its development.

It's likely these people will be of an old age and therefore most vulnerable to catching COVID-19.

The Ethics Advisory Board, chaired by Professor Sir Jonathan Montgomery, fear these people will be discriminated against in the future if the tool is used to identify people who do and don't have the disease.

There are suggestions the app could one day be used as an 'immunity passport' for regulating where people are and aren't allowed to go.

In theory it could be scanned before entering an office, supermarket or on public transport to ensure an individual is not at risk of spreading or catching the virus.

There has been no indication from the Government that this will happen, but it is occurring in other countries such as China.

Members of the advisory board (EAB) said their concerns have been 'skirted' as ministers race to launch the NHS app by the end of next week.

The rush leaves little time to sort out glitches, such as that the app doesn't work on some older mobiles or Huawei models, and to instill trust in the public that the app is safe and effective.

The NHS coronavirus contact tracing app (pictured) risks sidelining millions of people who don't have a mobile phone when ministers roll it out nationwide

The Ethics Advisory Board, led by Professor Sir Jonathan Montgomery, fear Britons who don't own phones will be discriminated against because they can't download the NHS coronavirus tracing app

The EAB for the app wrote to the Government to point out the most important ethical principles that must be considered.

In it, they noted that 21 per cent of UK adults do not use a smartphone, according to the communications regulator Ofcom.

It means almost 14million Britons would not be able to download the app, which has been touted as a crucial element of moving out of lockdown.

The app is part of the Government's 'test, track and trace' plan for controlling the virus and allowing the UK to re-open and return to some form of normality.

HOW WILL THE NHS APP WORK? NHSX's contact tracing app, which hasn't yet been named, will be a voluntary download that members of the public will be encouraged to use. The Government hopes at least half of the population of Britain will agree to use it. The more people use it the more effective it will be. It will require people to put in the first half of their postcode, to give vague location details, and to keep their bluetooth switched on when they leave the house. Whenever someone comes into close contact with someone else using the app - generally defined as within 6'6"" (2m) - the app will log the meeting. Each person's profile will then build up a list of all the contacts they have had while using the app. These will be anonymised and stored as codes rather than identifiable pieces of information such as names or addresses. If someone is diagnosed with the coronavirus, or develops suspicious symptoms, they will be told to log this in the app. The app will then upload the data to a central NHS server, which will be able to send anonymous warnings to everyone that that person had come into contact with during the time they may have been infectious. The alert will advise people to self-isolate and tell them they are at risk of infection. If one of the contacts of the original patient then becomes ill, the same process will begin with them.

It works using Bluetooth signals to detect when two phones come close to each other. When someone develops symptoms of COVID-19, they notify the app which then uses the Bluetooth log to inform other users that they may also have the virus.

Those people would be told to self isolate - although it is not clear for how long, exactly - in case they develop the virus.

Known as contact tracing, it is a way of keeping one step ahead of the virus by isolating people who don't have symptoms yet, but may still be infectious.

Professor Montgomery and colleagues said those who do not have smartphones must be protected by manual contact tracing.

This is also part of the Government's contact tracing scheme, and will involve a pledged 18,000 call handlers who conduct interviews with COVID-19 cases.

Commenting on the matter, cybersecurity specialist Jake Moore, from software protection company ESET, told MailOnline: 'There are still a large number of folk of an older age who don’t own a smartphone, and these people are predominantly those who are most at risk.

'It is vital that the older generations who are more susceptible to reacting badly to the virus are in fact using the app and able to be alerted quickly and efficiently to the notifications. However, if 21 per cent of Britons do not own a smartphone, then the app is arguably flawed for those most at risk.'

The letter also addressed concerns that those without the app will miss out on 'freedom of movement'.

It said: 'Will there be any risk of discriminating against certain groups who may be less able/likely to download this app?

'If the app becomes a tool for accessing currently restricted services or freedoms, such as permission to return to work, to use public transport, or to enjoy other freedoms, this would drastically alter the value proposition of the app and potentially introduce new levels of inequity which would need to be identified and addressed.'

Neither NHSX, which has developed the app, nor Government ministers have made reference to how the app could be used in any other way than to control the epidemic.

But this is happening in other countries. In China, for example, data is being used to regulate citizens' movement in an experiment.

Each individual has been given a QR code on their phone - green, amber or red, which lets others know if they are virus-free.

It dictates whether people should be quarantined or allowed into public spaces and has been dubbed a 'health passport'.

In some places QR codes are scanned at checkpoints, such as into buildings, letting the system know where they are and if they are posing a risk.

It's an authoritarian move which so far has not shown any possibility of happening in the UK.

However, experts say it is not impossible for this to happen in the future or for workplaces or businesses to take it upon themselves to do so.

There is talk of the app being used as an 'immunity passport' for regulating movement. It could be scanned going into an office, supermarket or on public transport to ensure an individual is not a contagion risk. But officials have not made reference to this

The Government will launch a widespread contact tracing scheme to track down people who have been in touch with infected patients

WHAT ARE THE SIX PRINCIPLES THE ETHICS BOARD ARE CALLING FOR? The Ethics Advisory Board sets out six ethical principles that will need to be adopted in order to ensure the app can be trusted. These are summarised below: 1. Value There must be good reason to believe that that the app will provide sufficient net-value back to society as a whole so as to justify its introduction and any consequences of it. To encourage people to download an app which does not offer a strong value proposition would be 'misleading and could damage trust', which could in turn reduce the effectiveness of the app. 2. Impact There must be good reason to believe the app will be an effective tool in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19. It would be 'unethical to encourage citizens to download an app which is technically flawed'. 3. Security and privacy Data sharing and storage should be secure. The data collected should be minimised and protected as much as possible, so users’ privacy is preserved. Any use of data which compromises a user’s anonymity should be done only for the protection of public health and in accordance with the law. 4. Accountability There must be a reliable and understandable decision-making process in place to manage the app - with clear democratic accountability, particularly with regards to introducing new functionality, data collection or use cases. There should be ongoing evaluation of the app to monitor both its effectiveness and any risks that arise from its use. Decision points about continued use of the app also need to be made clear. 5. Transparency Details on what data is gathered and why, as well as the app’s underlying algorithms, must be available publicly to enable scrutiny and give people the ability to object to decisions. All communications made via the app, and about the app, should be transparent. App alerts should state clearly what information they are based on. 6. Control Users should be able to see what kinds of data are held about them so that they can understand how it is impacting on decisions. Downloading the app should be voluntary. Users should be able to delete the app and their data at any point. Additional functionality would require clear communications and opt-ins for existing users.

The Board raised concerns about the fact the app relies solely on people reporting their COVID-19 symptoms, rather than actually having a test.

The NHS said tests would be delivered to anyone on the Isle of Wight who reported tell-tale COVID-19 signs. But it is not clear if this will be the case nationwide.

Self-reporting symptoms could leave to false alarms, whereby people are told they have been near someone with the coronavirus, when in fact they have not.

On the other hand, it could lead to a 'false sense of security', if the app fails to pick up at-risk people.

This has been flagged as a potential problem because Bluetooth signals are expected to vary in different situations, such as when someone's phone is in their pocket.

The Board cautioned against rolling the app out until anyone can access a test if they have symptoms.

However, this is highly unlikely given ministers pledge to get the app out by the end of next week.

At the moment, only key workers, such as NHS staff, their household members, people over 65 with symptoms and hospital or care home patients can access one.

Less than 100,000 tests are conducted every day, thousands of which are repeat tests to check a diagnosis is correct.

This is planned to be ramped up to 200,000 per day by the end of May. But doubt have been cast this will not be fulfilled because the testing system is struggling.

The EAB went on to set out six ethical principles that will need to be adopted in order to ensure the app can be trusted before its roll out.

It comes after a slew of experts and Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights appealed to Mr Hancock, the Health Secretary, to address privacy and data protection concerns.

Data concerns fundamentally fall down to the apps design, which has been highly criticised for being 'centralised'.

This means the NHS collects data on which phones have been in close proximity. Although this will be anonymised so the lists will only be codes, not lists of names or addresses, data privacy is not as tight as a 'decentralised' model.

Models by Apple and Google are 'decentralised', which means only the individual's phone logs data about where it has been.

The EAB urged for reassurance that data sharing and storage is secure so that users privacy will not infringed.

It discussed that for the app to be effective, the public must trust the Government. For this to happen, there must be transparency about what data is gathered and why.

Users should be able to see what data is collected so they can understand why, and be told if they delete the app, the data will also be wiped forever.

The EAB said it was aware rollout of the app was due imminently. But the rush to release the app should not undermine ethics.

One member of the EAB, Gus Hosein, said that in his view, the Government response to the ethics board had 'skirted all the equity concerns the board raised'.

'Instead, the minister says that the app will launch nationally, and imminently. Rushed, untested, unequal — this is not good for trust,' he said, according to the Financial Times.

Matt Hancock said on Tuesday the NHS app would be ready for England by mid-May.

But this has surprised experts, considering the app has only be trialled since May 5 and has already thrown up a number of glitches.

COVID-19 app development leader Geraint Lewis admitted the app does not work on the latest Huawei devices or some older mobile phones.

The new tool will only work with newer operating systems on Apple and Android phones.

Speaking to BBC Radio Solent, Mr Lewis said that devices must be running either Apple iOS 11 upwards or Android 8 or higher.

Ministers even revealed they would consider adopting a new model on Sunday, just one day before Mr Hancock said the app would be ready soon, after concerns were sparked about how the app stores data.

Mr Hosein said it was vital that the app 'is not limited to those of us with the latest and coolest tech'.

'If this app is going to work out, it needs to work for everyone. We are being asked to trust in the UK government, but they need to show that they are worthy of this trust.'

Mr Moore added: 'There is a huge pressure on the government to act quickly, but when tasks are urgent many things can suffer, such as privacy and security.

'Many privacy-conscious people are stuck in a dilemma as to whether or not to use the app; they want to help track and trace the virus and in turn save lives, but if the data is not secured with the upmost protection then there could be further problems down the line.'",15,Low,Right

People are now allowed to spend as much time as they like outdoors - as long as they keep socially distanced from others.

The first step out of the draconian lockdown, which has now been in place for 52 days, was announced by the Prime Minister on Sunday and began on Wednesday.

Scientists have said the minor tweak in rules is because there is a 'low risk' of the virus spreading between people outdoors.

Professor Alan Penn, a member of SAGE, the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, reassured that those who flock to the parks that the risk of catching the virus outside is lower.

He said: 'The science suggests that being outside in sunlight, with good ventilation, are both highly protective against transmission of the virus.'

Other scientists say they 'totally agree' with Professor Penn and advocate spending more time outdoors, where the virus is less likely to survive.

People are more likely to catch the infection in enclosed spaces with other people, where ventilation is poor and strangers touch the same surfaces regularly.

Viruses may be less able to survive on surfaces outside in sunlight, as UV damages their genetic material, meaning people are less likely to pick them up, scientists say.

Fresh air and sunshine are protective against the coronavirus, a government scientific adviser has said. Pictured, people sitting and sunbathing in Regent's Park, May 9

Professor Alan Penn, a member of SAGE, told MPs on Wednesday: 'The science suggests that being outside in sunlight, with good ventilation, are both highly protective against transmission of the virus'

Professor Penn, the chief scientific adviser at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, has attended four key SAGE meetings with ministers.

He spoke to MPs on Wednesday to explain why people's outdoor activities are not restricted any more.

The Government has said people can exercise as often as they like, an extension on the current one hour, and sunbathers won't be fined for heading to parks - so long as they obey strict social distancing rules.

People can meet with up to one person from outside their household, as long as they stay a two metre distance apart and meet in a public place, not a house or garden.

It's also acceptable to 'drive to outdoor open spaces irrespective of distance' as long as they are not in other parts of the UK.

But the slight relaxation on movement does not come without risks. If people break the rules, infection levels will rise again.

WILL SUMMER 'KILL' THE VIRUS? Studies suggest heat and humidity that is soon to come to the UK will only slightly reduce the transmission rate - not stop it in its tracks - which is why experts say being outdoors is 'low risk'. For example, the most recently published study, on May 9, said transmission risk was only reduced by about 1.5 per cent for every degree Fahrenheit above 77F (25C). US and Canadian researchers analysed more than 370,000 cases in thousands of different cities in North America to come to the conclusion 'summer is not going to make this go away'. Another study by researchers at Beihang and Singhua universities, however, suggested rising temperatures and humidity 'significantly' reduced the spread. Using their equation, if the temperature increased by 15 degrees C, or 27 degrees F, an infected person would spread coronavirus to about 0.6 fewer people. The scientists also pointed out that in the early dates of the outbreaks, countries with relatively lower air temperature and lower humidity, like Korea, Japan and Iran, saw severe outbreaks. But warmer and more humid countries, like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, did not. A separate study that compared transmission rates with the weather in 224 Chinese cities concluded there was no relationship. 'Our analysis suggested that ambient temperature has no significant impact on the transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2,' the researchers at Fudan University said. 'It is premature to count on warmer weather to control COVID-19, and relying on seasonality to curb this pandemic can be a dangerous line of thought. 'Changing seasons may help but are unlikely to stop transmission.' Commenting on the contradictory research, Professor Hunter said: 'The coronavirus might spread less rapidly because people tend to be outdoors in the summer more anyway. 'It's an indirect impact - we are not as crammed in together during the summer. Schools are closed, people go away on holiday, and people sit in open air to eat rather than in restaurants. 'But, and there is a big but, a lot of the evidence for that is based on seasonal illnesses [like the flu].' Advertisement

Speaking at the Science and Technology Select Committee, Professor Penn said the outdoors is 'protective' against the virus.

He told MPs: 'The route of transmission comes in three main forms. It comes from droplets, which is where the two-metre rule comes in, because droplets fall to the ground within two metres to a high degree.

'It comes from aerosols which float around more but carry less virus, and the touching of objects.'

When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, droplets that contain traces of the virus fly into the air from their nose or mouth.

Anyone who is within close proximity of that person can breathe those droplets into their lungs. But scientists say that two metres (6'6"") away is a safe distance.

Fallen droplets can land on surfaces such as doorknobs, tables, or desk appliances like keyboards, from which another person can pick up the virus.

The evidence that the virus can linger in the air is less certain, but not impossible.

'Most of the rules around what we should do, such as washing your hands, and not touching your face, are components of that transmission rule,' Professor Penn said.

'The way SAGE has judged the use of outside spaces is that this is one of the lowest-risk forms of activity.'

Professor Paul Hunter, a leading expert in diseases from University of East Anglia, said he 'totally agreed' with the comments.

He told MailOnline: 'The big thing about being outdoors is actually the droplets will be blown away quite quickly usually if there is a breeze.

'When you are talking to people outdoors, you should try to stand where the wind is moving across you and not towards someone else.

'The evidence [for COVID-19] is that aerosols are not that important anyway. But they tend to get inactivated quite quickly in sunlight so they wouldn't stay around for very long.'

Keith Neal, an emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases, University of Nottingham, explained that sunlight damages DNA and RNA in the virus, which would kill it.

'How quickly in affects COVID-19 I have not seen any work, but viruses left on surfaces outside will dry out and be damaged by UV light in sunlight,' he told MailOnline.

He added: 'I totally agree that outside is very much safer than inside - you can be further apart and conditions outside are less conducive to virus survival than inside.

'I would not have used the wording “protective against transmission” but more on the lines “very significantly lower risk of infection” – it’s the same thing really.'

Exposure to sunlight also boost levels of vitamin D, which is begging to rouse interest as a preventative against COVID-19.

Professor Neal said: 'There is some evidence that vitamin D supplements reduce the risk of respiratory virus infections, and there is good evidence that vitamin D deficiency impairs the immune system.'

Spanish researchers have recently started a trial to see whether vitamin D's anti-inflammatory properties can prevent COVID-19 symptoms from worsening.

Public health experts and scientists alike seem to agree that the virus poses less of a threat outdoors or in warm weather to some degree.

On March 30, Tracy Schofield, from Cambridge, Ontario, began experiencing symptoms such as chills, a fever, and shortness of breath.

The following day, she took her first test for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and the result was positive, reported CTV News.

Schofield, 49, spent the traditional two weeks self-isolating, but her second test came back positive. Since then, six more have returned the same result.

Doctors have told the mother-of-three that they don't believe she is contagious anymore, but that they can't explain why she keeps testing positive.

Tracy Schofield, 49 (left and right), from Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, tested positive for coronavirus on March 31. She spent two weeks self-isolating in her room at home, but her second test at the end of her isolation period came back positive

To be considered recovered, two negative tests need to be taken 24 hours apart. Schofield's eighth overall test from Cambridge Memorial Hospital (pictured) came back negative, but her ninth test was positive

'Whenever I get the test result, it's like somebody punches me in the stomach,' Schofield told CTV News.

'I just want someone to be able to tell me something. Give me an answer. Am I going to have it forever?'

For two weeks after her first positive test, Schofield says she self-isolated in her room at her house, where she lives with her 17-year-old son, Ethan.

Over that period, her temperature reached 104.1F and wouldn't come down with Tylenol. She says she also lost her sense of smell and taste.

'I couldn't smell Vick's VapoRub, I couldn't taste salt and vinegar chips,' Schofield told CTV News.

Now, almost two months later, the majority of her symptoms have disappeared aside from a cough and a little difficulty breathing.

However, her tests from Cambridge Memorial Hospital have kept returning positive.

Schofield says she was excited after her eighth overall test came back negative.

But patients must receive two negative results within a 24-hour period to be considered recovered. Her ninth test came back positive.

And, although authorities from Region of Waterloo Public Health, have allowed her to leave her house on April 14, she says she won't consider herself recovered until she gets her two consecutive negative test results.

Schofield says she has does not have any pre-existing conditions but she's concerned that she'll have long-term complications from the virus.

Schofield had been cleared to go back to work as a registered practical nurse but is scared about infecting others.

She is now waiting five days until she can take her tenth overall test.

Health experts say she likely just has dead virus cells still circulating in her body , CTV News reports.

It comes on the heels of news that patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus after having recovered are not contagious.

Researchers from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) looked at 285 survivors who tested positive after previous tests said they were negative.

None of the 790 people that the patients came into contact with were found to be infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

Evidence produced by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies highlights the wider damage being caused to young people by the halt to their education.

Although they admit there is no certainty, a raft of papers suggest that children are less likely to be infected and infectious than adults, and teachers do not seem at heightened risk.

The documents, prepared in the weeks up to May 1, float the idea of splitting classes in half and having children attend schools alternate weeks, saying that could slash the effect on the coronavirus 'R' number.

Ministers hope publishing the documents will reassure the public about plans to start reopening schools from June 1. But unions insisted the SAGE evidence was 'inconclusive' and demanded delay.

Downing Street also effectively conceded that many schools will opt not to bring back reception, year one and year six as Boris Johnson has suggested. The PM's spokesman said they would 'trust' headteachers to make decisions about how to proceed.

Tory MPs are increasingly turning on Education Secretary Gavin Williamson over his handling of the situation. One told MailOnline he should have been laying the ground with the unions for weeks as they were known to be 'very belligerent and very left-wing'. 'Gavin is screwing up. There has been a huge eff up here,' the senior MP said.

'Boris didn't just bounce him into it in 24 hours.'

Data shows that children have made up a tiny proportion of hospital patients with COVID-19, and an even smaller number of deaths from the coronavirus. Experts say children appear to be at a lower risk of catching and spreading the disease

Leading Cambridge University expert says risk for children catching COVID-19 is 'unbelievably low' The risk of children catching coronavirus is 'unbelievably low', according to one of the UK's top experts. Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter said data has also shown that teachers do not have a greater risk of becoming infected. The University of Cambridge professor's testimony comes amid an explosive row over the reopening of schools next month. Professor Spiegelhalter pointed out that just one out of 7million children aged four to 14 in England and Wales has died from COVID-19. He also claimed children carry just a fraction of the viral load compared to adults, which significantly reduces their ability to fall ill or infect others. Professor Spiegelhalter told the BBC: 'There have been, based on the data so far, extremely low risks to children. Out of 7million five to 14-year-olds in England and Wales, so far the number of death certificates revealed with Covid on it is one. 'There will be more [that haven't been confirmed], but there is still an extremely low risk. Of course we must remember this group of kids are staggeringly safe in general, less than one in 10,000 die every year. Nobody's ever been safer in the history of humanity than this group of kids.' Professor Spiegelhalter said that at least one child had died from a rare inflammatory illness linked to coronavirus, but reassured parents that the risk of the complication would now be 'much lower now the epidemic in the community is under control.' Asked about whether teachers and parents were being put at risk by schools reopening, the Cambridge professor said data suggested not. He added: 'The Office for National Statistics analysed Covid risks by occupation - some have higher risks, including bus drivers and care home workers.' But teachers were not included in this category, he said. 'Of course people are anxious about the rest of the family, but in healthy young parents aged between 20 and 40, there have only been about 30 death so far out of 30,000 who don't have existing conditions. 'There's about a three in a million chance of risk of death. That's a measurable risk, but in a sense it's a manageable risk... it's not overwhelming at all.' Advertisement

Speaking at the Downing Street briefing this evening, Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said reopening schools was likely to push the R rate up.

But he stressed that was the case for any change to lockdown, and schools were 'not a high risk area for R'.

He said coronavirus was a 'long term epidemic' and 'schools have to get back for education for our young people at some point'

Sir Patrick said: 'The risk for children (from coronavirus) is much lower - we know that.

'They are at low risk but not zero risk and there have been some serious cases of children, of course, but very few compared to adults and older age groups.

'The broader risk in terms of opening schools is that as soon as you introduce any contact, you put pressure on the R and you put pressure on numbers, and that's true of anything we are going to do in terms of changes to contact.'

He also delivered a shot across the bows of the government by noting that having test in trace in place was important when you were modifying lockdown.

Many of the concerns about schools returning appear to be over the knock-on impact on social distancing, with more mixing of families and parents returning to work.

A paper produced for a SAGE subgroup on schools for April 16 warns that 'a cohort of children have experienced a shock to their education which will persist and affect their educational and work outcomes for the rest of their lives'.

'Similarly, the current lockdown may lead to an increase in adverse childhood experiences... for example: domestic violence, poor parental mental health,child neglect or abuse.'

The report, prepared by experts from University College London, King's College London, the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Exeter, said such experiences were 'associated with worse long-term health outcomes, and will likely exacerbate existing societal inequalities (eg. across deprivation)'.

The group said it 'cannot be clear' the extent to which schools can be reopened without fuelling the virus.

Although the risk to pupils going back to school was 'very, very small' it was 'not zero'.

An assessment of various models of the impact of changes on the R rate shows the impact, on a scale of zero to one, would be 0.24 if classes were split and attended alternate weeks.

If half the class went in in the morning and half in the afternoon that would rise to 0.4. The maximum impact of one would be if schools came back completely.

A document from a behavioural insight meeting on May 1 said: 'Although not initially one of the options proposed by DfE, options 7b (classes split in two, with children attending on alternate weeks) emerged from the joint discussions as having particular potential merit for further consideration.'

The findings will likely add to arguments with unions over whether it is safe for children to return, and if it can be achieved without triggering another flare up of the virus.

The files emerged as a SAGE source claimed Government plans to reopen primary schools are grounded in welfare concerns rather than evidence younger pupils are less vulnerable.

In the first phase of his back-to-school blueprint, Boris Johnson wants children in England in reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1.

However, the exact shape of the reopening is being left in the hands of headteachers.

Teaching unions have been threatening to boycott the move over safety fears, while a slew of councils have said they will not fall into line. Nicola Sturgeon has said schools in Scotland will not reopen until August, after the usual summer holiday north of the border.

According to the SAGE papers, evidence on how likely children are to transmit Covid-19 remains 'inconclusive'.

Wider contextual issues - including whether families have black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) members - must be taken into account when assessing the impact of relaxing school closures on transmission.

Teachers do not appear to be at a greater risk of catching Covid-19 than other professions - but there is still some risk.

The Sage papers suggest that younger teachers' attendance in schools could be prioritised in order to decrease the likelihood of infection for school staff in more vulnerable groups.

The publication of the advice comes after education unions and council leaders called for the evidence underpinning the proposal to reopen schools in England to be released.

'Evidence remains inconclusive on both the susceptibility and infectivity of children, but the balance of evidence suggests that both may be lower than in adults,' one paper said.

Joint Secretary of the National Education Union (NEU) Dr Mary Bousted claimed the SAGE evidence showed the planned return was 'too soon'.

'We think it's just descending into chaos now and it's not funny,' she told Sky News.

'The evidence is still not there, we now have the Independent Sage Committee saying give it two weeks then we'll have half as much chance of catching the virus.'

Dr Bousted added in a statement: 'This points to a cavalier attitude towards the nation's children.

'The fact of the matter is that Sage has only weak evidence as to what extent children can transmit the virus to others...

'If we cannot be certain about the transmission of the virus - and it appears Sage cannot, either - then it is only right to exercise caution.'

Meanwhile, a separate study has found children have half the chance of catching coronavirus as adults.

University College London researchers analysed 6,000 studies looking into the link between the viral disease and children.

They found the risk of catching COVID-19 in children and teenagers was 56 per cent lower compared to adults over 20.

The scientists say their findings imply children are likely to play a lesser role in transmission of the disease because fewer of them get infected in the first place.

Lead author Professor Russell Viner told a press conference ahead of the paper's publication today that the results show the 'balance of risks for children is strongly towards a return to school'.

The UCL team are the latest experts to throw their support behind Boris Johnson amid a furious row about English schools restarting in June.

Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter, from Cambridge University, also claims the risk for children catching COVID-19 is 'unbelievably low'.

Yet the PM has faced ferocious backlash from parents and teaching unions for his plan to get children in reception, year 1 and year 6 back to school on June 1.

Scores of councils have refused to reopen amid fears pupils will spread the virus between each other, their teachers teachers and families.

Children have half the chance of catching coronavirus as adults, leading British scientists have found (Primary school children in Nice, France)

In the largest study of its kind, UCL scientists analysed 6,000 international scientific papers looking into children's susceptibility to infection and severity of illness.

Of them, just 18 were found to be of high enough quality to be considered in their analysis - half of which had not been peer-reviewed (scrutinised by other scientists).

Nine were contact-tracing studies, where researchers tracked close contacts of diagnosed patients.

Eight were population-screening studies, whereby random samples of society were tested for the virus.

And one was a systematic review of small household clusters, where entire families had been infected.

The analysis - yet to be published in a journal - showed that children and young people had 56 per cent lower odds of catching SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person, compared with adults over 20)

Researchers did not have sufficient data to examine whether children under 12 differed to teenagers in susceptibility.

Under-18s also appear to account for just one in 10 family clusters of the viral disease, although this was based on just one study so the evidence is weak.

While children appear less likely to catch the virus from others, once they are infected researchers remain uncertain about how likely children are to pass it on.

Lead author Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at UCL, said: 'There is an increasing amount of data now available on children and COVID-19, and this is the first comprehensive study to carefully review and summarise what we do and do not know about susceptibility and transmission.

'Our findings show children and young people appear 56 per cent less likely to contract COVID-19 from infected others.

'Susceptibility is a key part of the chain of infection, and this supports the view that children are likely to play a smaller role in transmitting the virus and proliferating the pandemic, although considerable uncertainty remains.

'This new data provides essential evidence to governments around the world to inform their decision-making on whether to reopen schools and reduce or end lockdown measures.'

Co-author Dr Rosalind Eggo, an infectious disease modeller at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'It [the study] suggests that children and young people are at lower risk of infection than adults and may therefore play a smaller role in the epidemic as a whole.

'This new evidence will help us better understand the possible effect of school reopening on transmission in schools and in the community.'

It comes after a report by the 'Independent SAGE' committee claimed it is not safe to reopen schools on June 1.

Sir David King - who chairs the 'Independent SAGE' committee and was Tony Blair's Chief Scientific Adviser when he was prime minister - said it is 'too soon' for children to return.

His alternative SAGE committee of experts says delaying schools reopening for two weeks would allow for the Government's 'test, trace and isolate' programme, including its delayed app, to be established.

In the first phase of his back-to-school blueprint, Boris Johnson wants children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1.

An expert on Downing Street's scientific advisory subcommittee on schools claimed that these specific year groups were selected based on worries for their education and wellbeing - not that they are more shielded to the disease.

Although age is a factor in how at-risk an infected person is to Covid-19 symptoms, modelling found there was 'no increased risk to one year group over another'.

The revelations that there is no difference in the vulnerability of certain year groups will likely whip up anger from teachers' unions, who claim social distancing is much harder to enforce in primary schools.",15,Low,Right

Earlier this week it emerged that all six of the monkeys that were used in the vaccine trial had gone on to catch the coronavirus.

They were also found to have the same amount of Covid-19 in their noses as three non-vaccinated monkeys, suggesting those who are vaccinated could still be infected and pass the virus on to others.

However, Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity, has defended the treatment, claiming that it achieves its primary purpose - namely to protect those who are vaccinated against the most severe effects of the virus.

Professor Andrew Pollard mounted a defence of the vaccine as it entered stage II trials

Oxford University's vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCov-19 has been rocked by criticism after all six monkeys that received it tested positive for coronavirus

Mounting a defence of the vaccine, Professor Andrew Pollard told the Today programme: 'That trial actually was on a small number of monkeys but what it showed is that the vaccine prevented pneumonia in those animals.

'That really supports moving the vaccine forward in humans because actually that's what we really want to know, is whether it can prevent pneumonia and severe infection in humans.'

The trial on monkeys also found that, unlike non-vaccinated primates, those that were vaccinated did not sustain any lung damage.

This, he claims provides an adequate basis for starting human trials.

The government has already pumped in the region of £90million into the research, and claimed a vaccine could be ready as early as September.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma revealed the UK plans to purchase as many as 30 million doses should the vaccine be proved effective.

The potential vaccine was steamrolled into human trials last month, with more than 1,000 people receiving the immunisation.

Scientists are now pushing it in to stage two, which will involve the vaccine being given to more than 10,000 people across the UK aged between five and more than 70 years.

Participants immune response to the vaccine will be assessed, to see if there is variation by age, before the trials will reach stage three.

They will also be left to live their lives as normal, to see whether the vaccine prevents infection following natural exposure.

Asked whether the government's September target was realistic, Prof Pollard said: 'It's very difficult to know exactly when we'll have proof whether the vaccine works.

'We need proof within our population of 10,000 people to have enough of those who have been exposed to the virus over that time who have been, are hopefully, in the control group to see whether the coronavirus vaccine protects them.

'There is uncertainty over how many cases there will be in the next few months.

'But if there are cases it is certainly possible by the Autumn to have a result. But it's not possible to predict.'

A coronavirus vaccine developed in Britain may not stop those treated being infected. Pictured: A volunteer is injected with the vaccine in Oxford University's vaccine trial

Meanwhile, some scientists have heaped criticism onto the vaccine, describing the results of the monkey trial as 'concerning'.

Dr William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor, said it was 'crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilising immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine'.

'It may provide partial protection. Will it be enough to control the Covid-19 pandemic?' he wrote in an article for Forbes.

'For an answer we can look to other diseases for which only partially effective vaccines exist - HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. The answers are not encouraging.'

Three of the six vaccinated monkeys in the trial also began breathing more rapidly than normal following infection, making them clinically ill, revealed a May 13 preprint on BioRxiv.

Low numbers of neutralising antibodies against the virus were also detected in monkeys that had received the vaccine.

Professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at Edinburgh University Eleanor Riley said the number of antibodies produced was 'insufficient' to prevent infection and viral shedding.

'If similar results were obtained in humans, the vaccine would likely provide partial protection against disease in the recipient but would be unlikely to reduce transmission in the wider community,' she said.

Professor of Molecular Biology at Nottingham University, John Ball, warned: 'The amount of virus genome detected in the noses of the vaccinated and un-vaccinated monkeys was the same and this is concerning.

'If this represents infectious virus and a similar thing occurs in humans, then vaccinated people can still be infected and shed large amounts of virus.

'This could potentially spread to others in the community.'

Business Secretary Alok Sharma has announced a deal between Oxford University and AstraZeneca which could see millions of vaccines available in the UK by September

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VACCINES CREATED BY OXFORD AND IMPERIAL COLLEGE? The science behind both vaccine attempts hinges on recreating the 'spike' proteins that are found all over the outside of the COVID-19 viruses. Both will attempt to recreate or mimic these spikes inside the body. The difference between the two is how they achieve this effect. Imperial College London will try to deliver genetic material (RNA) from the coronavirus which programs cells inside the patient's body to recreate the spike proteins. It will transport the RNA inside liquid droplets injected into the bloodstream. The team at the University of Oxford, on the other hand, will genetically engineer a virus to look like the coronavirus - to have the same spike proteins on the outside - but be unable to cause any infection inside a person. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. If the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person's bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future. The same process is thought to happen in people who catch COVID-19 for real, but this is far more dangerous - a vaccine will have the same end-point but without causing illness in the process.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma has said the government is hoping to be in a position to roll-out a mass vaccination programme in the Autumn of this year.

Mr Sharma praised the Oxford vaccine and said: 'The speed with which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.

'This new money will help mass produce the Oxford vaccine so that if current trials are successful we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.

'The UK will be the first to get access and we can also ensure that in addition to supporting people here, we are able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost.'

Imperial College London is also working on a vaccine to stop coronavirus, which it says aims to trigger a rapid immune response using the 'spike' protein on the virus surface.

It has received more than £20 million in funding so far.

However, Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial, said it is 'important not to have a false expectation that it is just around the corner'.

Prof Shattock said there are an estimated 100 coronavirus vaccines in development around the world.

But the 'most optimistic estimation' would suggest that one proven to be successful will not be 'readily available for wide scale use into the beginning of next year'.

He said it 'may take quite some time' for researchers to get all the data they need to prove without doubt that a vaccine actually works.

Asked if the UK is 'on the brink' of getting a working vaccine, Prof Shattock told the BBC: 'I think we need to distinguish two different things. One of the hurdles is making vaccine doses, obviously AstraZeneca can do that and that is a good thing but that is very different to having the data that proves that the vaccine actually works.

'We need to have those data to show that it is ready and appropriate to roll out. It may take quite some time to get that data, it is a numbers game.

'And in fact as we are better at reducing the number of infections in the UK it gets much harder to test whether the vaccine works or not.

Imperial's Professor Robin Shattock has said it 'may take quite some time' for researchers to develop a working vaccine

'There are no certainties, no guarantees in developing any of these candidates so I think it is important not to have a false expectation that it is just around the corner.

US firm Moderna's experimental vaccine shows potential to block coronavirus in human trials Moderna's experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced antibodies that could 'neutralize' the new coronavirus in patients in a small early stage clinical trial, the company announced Monday, sending its shares up by more than 20 percent. The levels of the antibodies - immune cells made in response to a germ, which may provide protection against reinfection - were similar to those in blood samples of people who have recovered from COVID-19, early results from the study conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) showed. Participants were given three different doses of the vaccine and Moderna said it saw dose-dependent increase in immunogenicity, the ability to provoke an immune response in the body. Moderna noted that the early trial is intended to determine the safety and side effects of the vaccine and, although the early results are promising, it's too soon to say whether the shot candidate can actually block the virus. The company has been in the lead of the US race to make a COVID-19 vaccine, and nearly neck-in-neck with an Oxford University effort to make one in the UK.

'It may be longer than any of us would want to think.'

Some health experts have suggested a vaccine could take as long as 18 months to develop while others have cautioned one may never be found.

Prof Shattock said: 'I think we need to keep context here. Obviously there could be some success, we could see things working earlier if we get the numbers and the kind of AstraZeneca approach is preparing for that success.

'But it is probably very likely that we won't really get the evidence until into early next year and then there is a difference between a solution in the UK which could be rolled out and a global solution.

'A global solution is likely to take much longer just because of the sheer operational effort to make billions of doses and make them available worldwide.'

Prof Shattock said he believed there is a 'very high chance of seeing a number of vaccines that work' as he said the evidence suggested coronavirus is 'not such a hard target as others'.

He added: 'My gut feeling is that we will start to see a number of candidates coming through with good evidence early towards next year - possibly something this year.

'But they won't be readily available for wide scale use into the beginning of next year as the kind of most optimistic estimation.'

Six drugs for treating coronavirus are currently in clinical trials worldwide.

China has four potential vaccines in clinical trials at present, three of which have entered stage two.

Trials of one vaccine developed by Beijing-based company Sinovac Biotech in April appeared to arrest the development of Covid-19 in monkeys.

However, it used a Sars-Cov-2 virus, whereas the Oxford vaccine uses a weakened version of adenovirus (common cold) that causes infections in chimpanzees, with the coronavirus spike protein added to it.

Sinovac Biotech has secured land and loans for it to develop a facility to mass produce any effective vaccine.

The Government's current lockdown rules state that you are allowed to meet up with one friend or family member from outside your household outdoors if you remain at least two metres apart.

Meanwhile, day trips to the park or to the beach are permitted with members of your household.

Rule-breaking campers in Devon and Cornwall were sent home by officers while traffic wardens issued more than 70 tickets in the coastal town of Woolacombe as all car parks were shut to keep away visitors.

Parks across the country have also been packed as people have met up with friends.

Mr Hancock suggested yesterday at the daily Downing Street press conference that a failure to adhere to restrictions could have devastating consequences.

He said: 'Let's not go back to square one. We can all play our part in the national effort.'

If the rate of transmission of coronavirus was to spike the Government would likely move to reimpose a stricter lockdown.

Senior police officers are increasingly concerned that some people appear to have given up on the rules with one chief constable telling The Times: 'I think people no longer understand what they can do - or think it is no longer important.'

Google footfall data published today suggested many people were not adhering to the rules even before Mr Johnson set out his plan to ease lockdown.

The data which is compiled by monitoring the number of mobile phones at a certain location showed that between May 4-8 activity in parks was above pre-lockdown levels with footfall 16 per cent above the baseline on May 6 and 7.

Nobel Prize-winning scientist tears into Boris Johnson's lack of political leadership A Nobel Prize-winning scientist tore into Boris Johnson's leadership during the coronavirus crisis today, claiming it was not clear 'who is actually in charge of the decisions'. Sir Paul Nurse said Britain has been constantly on the 'back foot' with a lack of clear planning resulting in ministers 'firefighting through successive crises'. The chief executive of the distinguished Francis Crick Institute said the country had been 'increasingly playing catch-up' and politicians should lay out 'a much clearer publicly-presented strategy'. Sir Paul's intervention came as the Government faced increasing pressure over its handling of the pandemic. It is facing ongoing criticism over the rate of deaths in care homes, a decision to abandon widespread testing early on and the slow roll out of a new contact tracing programme.

The baseline number is the average for the corresponding day during the five week period between January 3 and February 6.

However, the data did show that footfall in supermarkets and at transport hubs has remained much lower than normal during the lockdown period.

ONS data today suggested many people are not sticking to Mr Johnson's new guidance on only meeting one person outside their household outdoors.

A survey conducted between May 14 and 17 showed that 39 per cent of adults had visited a park or public green space in the past seven days.

But some 17 per cent admitted they had met up with friends or family from outside their household.

The ONS social impact survey also revealed some of the most common reasons why people have been leaving their homes during lockdown.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, number one on the list is to go shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine with 80 per cent of people having left their house for that reason.

Government expert says swifter lockdown could have saved thousands of lives Thousands of lives could have been saved from Covid-19 if Britain's lockdown was imposed just one week earlier, a government scientific adviser has claimed. Sir Ian Boyd, a member of Number 10's SAGE panel, admitted 'it would have made quite a big difference' if ministers acted sooner to contain the outbreak. Department of Health figures show 36,042 Brits have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, which began to rapidly spread in the UK in March. But the true number of Covid-19 victims is feared to be closer to the 60,000-mark, when suspected and indirect deaths are taken into account. Sir Ian's claim comes after research this week claimed triggering the UK's lockdown a week earlier would have saved tens of thousands of lives. The shock study suggested enforcing strict rules to fight the coronavirus crisis on March 16 could have limited the number of deaths to 11,200. Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent the country into lockdown on March 23.

Second on the list was exercise with 70 per cent while travelling to and from work was third with 28 per cent.

Some 12 per cent of people said they had left their home during lockdown to run errands.

The data also suggested much of the population believes the UK will be fundamentally changed in its outlook by the current outbreak.

Some 42 per cent of respondents said they believed Britain to be kind before the outbreak.

But 61 per cent said they believed Britain will be kind after the current pandemic.

The survey showed widespread disquiet over the impact the outbreak is having on daily life.

Just shy of three quarters of adults (72 per cent) said they were concerned at the damage coronavirus was doing to their lives.

Levels of concern were slightly higher among at-risk groups with 73 per cent of over-70s and 82 per cent of those with underlying health conditions saying they were concerned.

Women were more likely to show higher levels of concern about the impact of the virus than men, 79 per cent to 66 per cent.

The most common concern expressed by respondents was a 'lack of freedom and independence' with almost two thirds of adults saying this was affecting them.

An inability to make plans was cited as a major concern by 54 per cent of UK adults.

The findings come after a major study found less than half of 19 to 30-year-olds are 'strictly' abiding by the lockdown rules.

Among all adults the figure has dropped from 70 per cent to under 60 per cent in the last fortnight.",15,Low,Right

A Nobel Prize-winning scientist tore into Boris Johnson's leadership during the coronavirus crisis today, claiming it was not clear 'who is actually in charge of the decisions'.

Sir Paul Nurse said Britain has been left on the 'back foot' with a lack of clear planning that left it ''firefighting through successive crises', in a scathing attack on the political establishment.

Sir Paul, the chief executive of the distinguished Francis Crick Institute, said the country had been 'increasingly playing catch-up' and scientists and politicians should lay out 'a much clearer publicly-presented strategy' to tackle the pandemic.

Sir Paul's intervention came as the Government faces increasing pressure over its handling of the pandemic. It is facing ongoing criticism over the rate of deaths in care homes, a decision to abandon widespread testing early on and the slow roll out of a new testing regime.

Last night Mr Johnson was forced to u-turn over a widely unpopular decision to make foreign NHS and care staff pay a surcharge to access healthcare in the UK, while working to save British lives.

The PM is also coming under increasing scrutiny for a lack of public appearances, interviews and press conferences since his return to work from his coronavirus hospitalisation.

He has taken just one of the daily news conferences in Number 10, on May 11, with other ministers taking charge.

Apart from his address to the nation on May 10, his only other visible public appearances have been two underwhelming performances at Prime Minister's Questions.

But this afternoon he did finally agree to face MPs' questions next week with an appearance at the Commons' Liaison Committee.

A senior Tory MP told MailOnline that they were concerned Mr Johnson looked to have 'lost his edge' and was not fully recovered from his illness.

'Under normal circumstances he would probably have been taking it easier. The guy was close to death… there was pressure on him to come back. People don't usually come back to the pressure that he has been under,' the MP said.

'He is back in the firing line, running UK plc with 67million people and all the problems that is has got.'

For most workers colleagues would ensure they were 'out of the door at 5.20pm latest and make sure he has his weekends off', the Tory said.

'Boris has lost that edge. You could say Boris, we need you to take a really difficult turn, and he would use his common sense and get out of it.

'The illness may have had an impact. The spontaneity... I wonder whether mentally he's not as sharp because he's been seriously ill.'

Sir Paul Nurse said Britain has been left on the 'back foot' with a lack of clear planning that left it ''firefighting through successive crises', in a scathing attack on the political establishment.

The geneticist, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2001, criticised the PM (pictured last night), telling the BBC's Today Programme: 'I'm not completely convinced that we are actually being quite clear in having good leadership'

The MP said they still thought the PM would emerge from the situation, suggesting any government would be under fire at this point. 'We are on a sticky wicket. You don't have to look too much under the surface to find things to be critical about,' they said.

The future of 'spoons: Boss Tim Martin reveals plans to REOPEN 875 pubs JD Wetherspoon today revealed its £11million masterplan to reopen its 875 pubs as soon as the Government gives them the nod in July - but while the blueprint promises social distancing there is no mention of the two-metre rule experts say will decimate the hospitality sector. Drinkers will be told 'not to meet in large groups' and will be expected to sanitise their hands on arrival and at other times during their visit. They will follow one-way systems to the toilets and through the bar where the tills will be screened off to protect staff likely to be wearing masks, gloves and eye protection, the chain said. Staff will hand over all drinks holding the base of the pint or wine glass and when ordered via a smartphone they will be delivered to the table on a tray for the customers to take themselves to reduce the chances of spreading Covid-19. Families will be asked to keep children seated and always accompanied to the toilet. The 875 pubs in UK and Ireland will open during its usual hours of 8am to around 1am and encourage customers to order using its app with posters put up telling them 'there is no need to visit the bar'. But people can pay by cash or card at the till if necessary and must not move any furniture Advertisement

But they warned that Sir Keir Starmer had been making headway in the Commons. 'It is going down well. We need to be careful. Keir is a savvy guy. He can think on his feet,' the MP said.

Geneticist Sir Paul, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2001, told the BBC's Today Programme: 'I'm not completely convinced that we are actually being quite clear in having good leadership.

'The question I keep asking myself is: Do we have a proper Government system in here that can combine tentative knowledge, scientific knowledge, with political action?

'And the question I'm constantly asking myself is: Who is actually in charge of the decisions? Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy?

'Is it ministers? Is it Public Health England? The National Health Service? The Office for Life Sciences, Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies)? I don't know, but more importantly, do they know?'

Last night another top scientist claimed thousands of lives could have been saved from Covid-19 if Britain's lockdown was imposed just one week earlier.

Government scientific adviser Sir Ian Boyd, a member of Number 10's SAGE panel, admitted 'it would have made quite a big difference' if ministers acted sooner to fight the outbreak.

Department of Health figures show 36,042 Brits have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, which began to rapidly spread in the UK in March.

The Government is expected to unveil a new quarantine scheme today that forces anyone entering the UK to isolate for 14 days.

And so-called coronavirus 'immunity certificates' that could allow Britons to return to work have come a step closer after ministers announced that mass antibody tests are being deployed.

NHS and care workers will start to be given the tests from next week after Matt Hancock announced the government has signed a contract for 10 million kits.

The screening will finally show who has been through the disease and emerged with some level of resistance, a blind spot that has so far been a major blow to the UK response.

Asked about the country's approach to the outbreak on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Paul said: 'I'm not sure we are quite getting it right.'

Sir Paul added: 'Everybody involved, not just the politicians, the scientists and the doctors, we're all making mistakes and we have to try and learn from what mistakes have been made up until now.

'I get a sense the UK has been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting through successive crises.'

He suggested that what was needed was to 'get a much clearer publicly-presented strategy as to what we're actually trying to do, and the evidence upon which it is based'.

Sir Paul added: 'And we're not getting that in communications. Maybe there's a strategy there, I don't see it.'

Detailed statistics show that more than 44,000 people have already died with COVID-19 in the UK, but a study from the University of Southampton suggested that number could have been kept to 11,200 if lockdown was introduced earlier

Asked about the use of quarantine, Sir Paul suggested more evidence was needed about the infectiousness of people with coronavirus and how this was revealed through symptoms.

Australia pushes to be first country exempted from UK's new 14-day quarantine rules as arrivals face 'spot checks' on homes Australia is pushing to be the first country exempted from the UK's new 14-day coronavirus quarantine - as arrivals face 'spot checks' on homes and £1,000 fines for breaking the rules. Ministers are due to unveil plans for mandatory isolation of everyone coming into the country, in a bid to stop the deadly disease flaring up again. Those who flout the orders face £1,000 fines, followed by even tougher penalties if the they fail to pay. Arrivals will be required to supply an address where they will be isolating, enforced by public health officers carrying out random visits. Exemptions from the tough regime will be extremely limited to start with, mainly covering lorry drivers, NHS workers and fruit pickers considered essential to run the economy and health services. Free movement with Ireland will also be maintained, with the Common Travel Area a key part of the peace deal. The system is not expected to be finalised until the Commons returns from recess at the beginning of next month. However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has already raised the prospect of 'air bridges' to low-infection countries being introduced at a later stage. Reports in Australia suggest PM Scott Morrisson is pushing for his country, which has almost wiped out the virus, to be left out of the curbs.

He said: 'Because for a long time it's been clear that people without symptoms can be infected and therefore be infectious to other people and yet in the hospitals and in the care homes we haven't been testing such people.

'So we have been allowing people, care workers, to be in the ward, who are potentially infected, infecting patients, infecting themselves, and as a consequence making hospitals potentially unsafe places to be.

'We have to see a changed strategy there that is reliant upon the real evidence.'

He continued: 'I don't see clarity in the public sphere about these sorts of arguments that need to be shown to the public so that they feel actually they are safe when they go to hospital.'

Sir Paul said there was 'another mistake' when the testing strategy was put in place.

He said: 'There were many laboratories around the country, smaller laboratories, that could have got a major, major increase in testing capacity much more quickly than was possible with the big labs.'

Sir Paul said he did not think there should be a formal inquiry into the UK's response to the outbreak now, but more 'openness' was needed, alongside a 'greater debate in the public domain'.

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he 'wouldn't agree' with Sir Paul's criticism, explaining that the Government has followed 'the best advice that is out there'.

He said: 'I think what we have seen through this actually is we as a Government have been very clear with people, very transparent with people.

'The Prime Minister himself has been very clear - the Prime Minister ultimately is responsible.

'We do follow the best advice that is out there from both the scientific advisers, our chief medical advisers and the teams there but ultimately it is the ministers who make decisions.

'And I think that is one of the things we have seen throughout this process, is our working to ensure we get as much information to people as we can to ensure that people understand what we can all do to play our part in keeping the R level down.'

Thousands of lives could have been saved if Britain imposed lockdown a WEEK earlier than March 23, claims government scientific adviser

Sir Ian Boyd, a member of Number 10's SAGE panel, admitted 'it would have made quite a big difference' if ministers acted sooner to fight the outbreak

Thousands of lives could have been saved from Covid-19 if Britain's lockdown was imposed just one week earlier, a government scientific adviser has claimed.

Sir Ian Boyd, a member of Number 10's SAGE panel, admitted 'it would have made quite a big difference' if ministers acted sooner to fight the outbreak.

Department of Health figures show 36,042 Brits have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, which began to rapidly spread in the UK in March.

But the true number of Covid-19 victims is feared to be closer to the 60,000-mark, when suspected and indirect deaths are taken into account.

Sir Ian's claim comes after research this week claimed triggering the UK's lockdown a week earlier would have saved tens of thousands of lives.

The shock study suggested enforcing strict rules to fight the coronavirus crisis on March 16 could have limited the number of deaths to 11,200.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent the country into lockdown on March 23, 60 days ago, banning people from meeting up with others or making unnecessary trips.

Britain was one of the last countries in Europe to put the rules in place - Germany, Belgium, France, Spain and Italy had done it days or weeks earlier.

WHEN DID OTHER COUNTRIES GO INTO LOCKDOWN AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THEM? An report published in March by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team outlined the dates on which various countries in Europe started their lockdown measures. Each is listed below, alongside the COVID-19 death toll for each country, as of May 20. The numbers on their own do not suggest a direct link between the timing of lockdown and the number of people who died, showing that other factors come into play. The most comparable countries in size to the UK are France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Austria: March 16; 633 deaths

Belgium: March 18; 9,150 deaths

Denmark: March 18; 561

France: March 17; 28.022

Germany: March 22; 8,193

Italy: March 11; 32,169

Norway: March 24; 233

Spain: March 14; 27,778

Sweden: No lockdown; 3,743

Switzerland: March 18; 1,883

United Kingdom: March 24; 35,341

Sir Ian, a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews, told The Coronavirus Newscast: 'Acting very early was really important.

'I would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate.

'And I think that's really the number one issue - could we have acted earlier? Were the signs there earlier on?'

He said the UK, as well as some of its European counterparts, were 'slower off the mark' than nations that had battled SARS in the early 2000s.

SARS, caused by another type of coronavirus, infected 8,000 people worldwide and killed 774 people in a year in 2002.

Sir Ian added: 'One could point the finger at ministers and politicians for not being willing to listen to scientific advice.

'You could point the finger at scientists for not actually being explicit enough. But at the end of the day all these interact with public opinion as well.

'And I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasn't feasible because people wouldn't have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did.'

The membership of the secretive SAGE committee which has been advising the Government on its handling of coronavirus was finally made public earlier this month.

A TIMELINE OF THE UK'S COVID-19 LOCKDOWN February 28: Virus started spreading uncontrollably in Britain, according to the World Health Organization. March 3: Government and NHS officially launched campaign urging people to wash their hands more often. March 12: Anyone who developed a fever or a new cough, regardless of whether they got tested for COVID-19, was told to self-isolate for two weeks. March 16: Social distancing begins: Public were told to avoid contact with people outside of their homes, to work from home where possible, and to only take essential travel, such as to and from work or medical appointments.

Pubs and restaurants are not forced to close but people are encouraged to avoid them.

Likewise, the Government refused to ban large gatherings and sports events but said police and ambulances would no longer be provided for them. March 20: Major businesses were ordered to close immediately, including gyms, leisure centres, pubs, cafes, restaurants, theatres and cinemas. March 23: Full lockdown introduced: In a speech to the nation Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to stay at home unless necessary, only leaving to shop, to go to medical appointments or to exercise once per day.

Gatherings of people were banned, regardless of size, and people prohibited from mixing with others outside of their household.

Everyone was told to work from home if possible. Many non-essential workers were forced to stop working if they couldn't do it from home.

Schools shut their doors except to the children of essential workers. March 24: All non-essential businesses, including clothing shops and hairdressers, were ordered to close.

The names of those who sit on the panel had not previously been published on security and independence grounds.

But officials bowed to mounting pressure and released the names of 50 experts across many fields who have sat in regular meetings during the pandemic.

The names on the list included well-known figures who have been involved in the daily press conferences, including chairman Sir Patrick Vallance.

It also included Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and his deputies Dr Jenny Harries and Professor Jonathan Van Tam.

Others present were epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson and Dr Demis Hassabis, the chief executive of Google's DeepMind subsidiary.

Dr John Dagpunar, from the University of Southampton, echoed Sir Ian's claims in shock research published earlier this week.

He said in his paper: 'Literally, each day's delay in starting lockdown can result in thousands of extra deaths.'

Dr Dagpunar, a mathematical sciences expert, added: 'It does pose the question as to why lockdown did not occur earlier?'

He predicted how different scenarios may have affected the progress of the Covid-19 outbreak in Britain.

Starting the lockdown a week earlier on March 16 could have limited the number of deaths to 11,200, his analysis showed.

Dr Dagpunar's study considered the number of people infected with the virus, its rate of reproduction, hospital bed and staff capacity, and the proportion of patients who die, among other factors.

He calculated the death rate to be one per cent, and the pre-lockdown reproduction rate (R) to be 3.18, meaning every 10 patients infected a further 32.

The paper estimated that 4.4 per cent of all patients need hospital treatment, 30 per cent of whom will end up in intensive care.

Of the intensive care patients, a hospital stay lasts 16 days on average and half of them go on to die.

Of the other 70 per cent, a hospital stay averages eight days and 11 per cent die.

The study suggested that a lockdown which began a week earlier - on March 16 - would have led to a total of 11,200 people dying and just two per cent of the population catching the virus (98 per cent susceptibility)

A second model, which most closely aligns with what is happening in the UK right now, suggests that six per cent of the population get infected and around 39,000 people die. The demand for hospital beds is considerably higher than in the previous estimate. Britain is known to have more than 44,000 deaths already so this estimate is still too low

The study suggests that an earlier lockdown would have led to smaller peaks in deaths and demand for hospital beds

Dr Dagpunar's research showed a sharper, higher peak in deaths and demand for hospital beds in the UK's current situation, in which the lockdown began on March 23. The total death toll for this model (39,000) has already been exceeded, however

The Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, which has been advising the Government, estimated in March that the global average R0 of the coronavirus was 3.87. As social distancing and lockdown took effect that number has now plummeted to below 1, potentially as low as 0.5, meaning the virus will die out naturally if this continues

Experts suggested coronavirus was 'disappearing' from the UK, with deaths down and new cases in London below 50 a day

BUSINESS CHIEFS AND MPS CALL FOR QUICK LOCKDOWN EXIT Business leaders and politicians last night pleaded with the Government to unlock the economy and get Britain moving after figures appeared to show the Covid-19 outbreak was coming under control. Experts suggested coronavirus was 'disappearing' from the UK, with deaths down and new cases in London below 50 a day. Official figures revealed on Thursday how deaths, hospital admissions and new infections have dropped significantly since the epidemic peaked in early April. The R-rate – which shows how quickly the virus is spreading – is also said to be falling. Professor Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, said coronavirus was 'disappearing at a rate that's speeding up', and urged politicians to 'open up businesses' to prevent a second wave of deaths caused by economic collapse. Conservative former leader Iain Duncan Smith said: 'We need to move fast. The threat facing us now, outweighing coronavirus, is that of a failing economy.' Tory ex-minister John Redwood said: 'We are going to have unemployment on a scale not seen for many a year... unless we get furloughed people back to work.'

Running these factors through an algorithm based on the timing of the UK's outbreak, Dr Dagpunar suggested that the March 23 lockdown could have resulted in a total of around 39,000 deaths.

Britain is known to have passed this grim landmark number already, suggesting that the study's estimate of fatality rate, virus R rate, or another factor, is too low.

If lockdown had been started a week earlier, on March 16, the model suggested, there could have been a 'very large reduction' in deaths, limiting them to around 11,200.

The virus would have infected four per cent less of the population in this scenario (two per cent compared to six per cent), the study said, and the demand for hospital beds would have been lower.

Dr Dagpunar said: 'In hindsight [this] clearly illustrates that earlier action was needed and would have saved many lives.'

'Literally, each day's delay in starting suppression (lockdown) can result in thousands of extra deaths.

'The same is true for premature relaxation, acknowledging that the rate of decline is less than the rate of growth, so the effect although severe is not quite as strong.

'These conclusions are the incontrovertible consequence of the exponential growth and decline of a managed epidemic.'

Dr Dagpunar's paper was published on the website medRxiv without being checked by other scientists or journal editors.

Polls of Brits show around two thirds of people think the government took too long to put the UK in lockdown.

But other experts say ministers 'lost sight' of the evidence and rushed into lockdown, praising Sweden for holding its nerve and not shutting down the economy.

Surveillance studies have shown the crucial R rate had already began to drop before the draconian measures were introduced.

So-called coronavirus 'immunity certificates' that could allow Britons to return to work have come a step closer after ministers announced that mass antibody tests are being deployed.

NHS and care workers will start to be given the tests from next week after Matt Hancock announced the government has signed a contract for 10 million kits.

The screening will finally show who has been through the disease and emerged with some level of resistance, a blind spot that has so far been a major blow to the UK response.

At the Downing Street briefing last night, the Health Secretary stressed that the science of whether people develop immunity, and how long it lasts, was still emerging.

However, he confirmed that ministers are already looking at a 'system of certification' that would signify people who are safe to go back to work and mix freely with others.

The prospect has already raised concerns about the social impact - with the government's own experts warning that those who are not immune could be shunned and desperate individuals might deliberately try to get infected.

Mr Hancock said: 'We're developing this critical science to know the impact of a positive antibody test and to develop the systems of certification to ensure people who have positive antibodies can be given assurances of what they can safely do.'

He added: 'We're not yet in a position to say that those who test positive in these antibody tests are immune from coronavirus.

'But as our understanding of the disease improves, the insight these antibody tests provide will be crucial.'

Earlier this month, a spokesman for Boris Johnson said there was the possibility of issuing some kind of certificate based on immunity but that scientists still needed to know more about that subject area.

It remains unknown whether people who have recovered from coronavirus have any immunity from catching it again.

But ministers hope that if scientists do prove immunity exists, certificates will allow people to return to the workforce and to ditch social distancing regulations.

This could allow an elderly patient with a positive result to go to hospital for hip surgery, in the knowledge that they were highly unlikely to catch the virus on the ward.

Equally a doctor or nurse with a positive result could be redeployed to virus wards as they would also be at very low risk.

Announcing the antibody test rollout at the Downing Street press conference yesterday, Mr Hancock said: 'It's not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring.

'It's that knowing you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus.

The Health Secretary told yesterday's briefing: 'We're developing this critical science to know the impact of a positive antibody test and to develop the systems of certification to ensure people who have positive antibodies can be given assurances of what they can safely do'

The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said: 'This could be a game changer – and it is great that we now have a reliable antibody test.

'As the Government acknowledges of course there are still unknowns. We don't yet know whether antibodies mean you are immune.'

Earlier the Prime Minister's spokesman said the tests would be 'free for people who need them, as you would expect'.

The Department of Health hopes to carry out 40,000 antibody tests a week although they will initially be performed in hospitals rather than at home.

They will initially be offered to NHS staff and care workers but some patients will be able to request them via their doctors.

These could include key workers – teachers, train drivers or prison staff.

Ten million of the tests have been ordered from Abbott, Roche and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics.

Separately, the Heath Secretary outlined preliminary findings from research involving antibody tests which suggest 5 per cent of people nationally, and 17 per cent in London, have already had the virus.

And he revealed ministers are trialling an on-the-spot test to tell patients if they have the virus in just 20 minutes – up from the current average of two days.

This would let them return to work the same day if they were negative rather than self-isolating just in case while they awaited results.

If deemed effective, it will be rolled out nationally within six weeks.

More than five million people have been infected with coronavirus worldwide, with Latin America now seeing the largest rise in cases each day.

Speaking at yesterday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock tried to play down the failure to get the NHS coronavirus app off the ground, which has been further pushed back from its planned launch in mid-May.

WHY IS ANTIBODY TESTING IMPORTANT? WHAT IS AN ANTIBODY TEST? Unlike tests to diagnose diseases, antibody tests show who has been infected and recovered. The body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses and infections, including other coronaviruses. New blood tests are being developed to identify antibodies unique to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. The tests look for two kinds of antibodies: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG). The body quickly produces IgM antibodies for its initial attack against infections. It makes IgG antibodies more slowly and retains them longer; IgG antibodies suggest possible immunity. HOW CAN ANTIBODY TESTS HELP END LOCKDOWNS? Antibody tests can help calculate what portion of the population has already been infected, as well as whether infections were mild or severe. Governments and companies could use antibody tests to determine who would most likely be safe to return to work and public interactions, and whether it is safe to lift stay-at-home orders all at once in some regions or in stages based on infection risk. People with negative antibody tests or very low antibody levels would likely have higher risk of infection than people with high antibody levels. DO ANTIBODIES TO THE NEW CORONAVIRUS CONFER IMMUNITY? While antibodies to many infectious diseases typically confer some level of immunity, whether that is the case with this unique coronavirus is not yet known. And how strong immunity might be, or how long it might last in people previously infected, is not clear. With some diseases like measles the immunity can be lifelong. With others, immunity can wane over time. Scientists cannot know with certainty that reinfection is not possible until further research. Antibody tests could inform not just lockdown exits, but the best approach to treatments and vaccines. Advertisement

The app is considered vital to the Government's new 'test, track and trace' programme, which No10 has already re-branded by dropping the 'tracking.'

Without the system in place, scientific advisers on Downing Street's SAGE committee say that Britain cannot ease its lockdown without triggering a catastrophic second spike.

Mr Hancock said the app was 'an important part, but it is not the only part,' and instead moved the focus onto the incoming antibody tests.

'This is an important milestone, and it represents further progress in our national testing programme,' he said.

It comes amid mounting pressure on the Health Secretary after he repeatedly failed to deliver on his ambitious promise of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day.

The Government are, therefore, deeply anxious for the 'test, track and trace' strategy to bear fruit.

One source close to Mr Hancock told The Telegraph: 'He knows his job is on the line if this doesn't work.'

A&E departments, GP testing hubs and care homes in Hampshire will all trial the new test, which will be used on up to 4,000 people.

The test does not need to be sent off to a lab and will be rolled out if it is shown to be effective, Mr Hancock said.

On the Government's 'test, track and trace' programme, Mr Hancock sought to play down the importance of the delayed app. However, experts believe the app is an integral part of the programme and that without it the UK could struggle to get back to normal life.

He had originally said the app would be rolled out by mid-May but it has now been delayed by several weeks.

The Government is aiming for 25,000 human contact tracers to be in place for June 1 - the earliest date for opening schools and non-essential shops in England.

Mr Hancock said trials of the app in the Isle of Wight had shown the human contact tracing elements were also important so people can understand the consequences of what is required if they have been near someone with coronavirus.

Professor John Newton, of Public Health England, said there could be advantages in doing the contact tracing process without the app initially.

Before the press briefing, Downing Street announced a U-turn on the NHS surcharge, saying overseas health and care staff will be exempted from the fee levied on migrants to pay for the NHS.

It came after mounting pressure on Mr Johnson from senior Tories, with former party chairman Lord Patten calling the charge 'appalling' and 'monstrous'.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who urged the PM in the Commons on Wednesday to scrap the charge, said: 'Boris Johnson is right to have U-turned and backed our proposal to remove the NHS charge for health professionals and care workers.

'This is a victory for common decency and the right thing to do. We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next.'

The decision came a day after another U-turn when the Government extended a scheme offering indefinite leave to remain to the families of all NHS staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus.

How accurate is Roche's newly-approved antibody test and will it show you if you are immune?

Here, MailOnline reveals everything you need to know about Roche's antibody test, from how accurate it is to how it will be used in the UK.

HOW WILL IT BE USED IN THE UK?

The kits are lab-based tests and require blood samples to be taken by trained health professionals.

The blood sample kit can be processed by machines already used in NHS labs across the country. Medics can get results in just 18 minutes.

Health minister Edward Argar said the tests would mainly be given to NHS and social care workers to start with.

Insiders say it is also likely to play a role in the government's 'surveillance' schemes, which will help track how far the virus has spread in Britain.

Ministers are currently clueless about the true size of Britain's outbreak because health chiefs abandoned a mass-testing regime early on in the crisis.

One of the current antibody schemes already underway has seen nurses take blood samples from a thousand households.

Early results - not yet published by officials - suggested up to four per cent of Britain has developed antibodies to the coronavirus.

CAN I USE THE ROCHE TEST MYSELF?

The Roche test, which is called Elecsys, is simply not designed to give people a result in the comfort of their own home.

Ministers have promised 'pregnancy-test' style kits, which would see Brits take their own blood sample and get a result in as little as 10 minutes.

But no DIY test - scientifically called an immunoassay - has yet to be approved by officials despite promises one would be available back in March.

One firm - awarded millions of pounds by the government to produce home-testing kits - hopes to have its product ready by the start of June.

Mologic's serology test will be available for Britons to purchase online, from retailers such as Boots and Amazon, according to reports.

It has not yet been approved by the Bedfordshire-based company is in 'urgent talks' with ministers to fast-track approval, The Telegraph says.

HOW MUCH WILL THEY COST THE GOVERNMENT?

Roche - which plans to produce millions of the kits each month - has not revealed how much the antibody test will cost to purchase in bulk.

Britain did, however, pay two Chinese firms around £16million for 2million antibody tests that failed strict accuracy tests - suggesting each kit cost around £8.

No details of any deals struck between Roche - based in Basel - and other countries have been made public.

This means it is not known whether Britain will pay more or less than other nations desperately seeking the antibody tests as draconian lockdowns are eased.

Roche - which operates two offices in Britain - has not revealed if it will manufacture the tests in the UK. The firm says it has 'extensive global manufacturing capabilities' to meet demand.

Following the announcement today, shares for Roche rose slightly to 44.95, the highest in several weeks, according to Yahoo! Finance

THE TIMELINE OF UK'S ANTIBODY TESTING DEVELOPMENTS March 25: Professor Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at PHE, told MPs antibody kits would be ready within days. But confusion was sparked when chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told revealed the tests would not be ready to buy online within days. March 26: Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, told MPs she expected home antibody tests to be available within a 'couple of weeks'. April 1: In the Downing Street press conference, Professor Doyle disputed the claim that PHE was 'dragging its feet' in approving antibody tests. She said: 'The important thing about theses antibody tests, this is not a matter of dragging our feet, it's important that the test is valid, that it does what it says it does.' April 6: Sir John Bell, one of the Oxford University team evaluating antibody tests for the government, revealed none of them performed well. April 17: The New York Times reported that Britain was seeking a £16million refund after two antibody tests it had bought from Chinese companies were not accurate enough to be rolled out. April 21: University of Oxford experts published anonymised results of the nine tests the government had bought - they showed all were deemed too weak to use. Their sensitivity – ability to correctly spot people who had had the disease - ranged from 70 per cent to just 55 per cent. May 3: US regulators gave the 'game-changing' antibody test made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche the green light. May 4: German health bosses announce a deal with Roche to buy 3million of its kits in May, as well as 5million per month from June. May 13: Public Health England follows suit, approving the test to be used. It was revealed that health chiefs were planning to buy millions.

WILL PRIVATE FIRMS BE ABLE TO BUY THE TESTS?

Officials have yet to come forward with a concrete plan about how the tests will be used, or whether private firms will be able to buy them.

Many companies keen to restart operations want to use antibody testing kits to work out how much of their staff may be immune to the virus.

Insiders say it is unlikely the Roche tests will be available to purchase privately, at least initially.

This is because officials wouldn't be able to access the data they desperately need to plot the spread of the virus.

It remains unclear exactly how much the lab-based tests could cost, if and when they can be purchased.

WHO ELSE HAS APPROVED THE ROCHE ANTIBODY TEST?

Roche first announced it was developing the antibody on April 17, revealing it had plans to put it on the market in early May.

At the time, it announced it was working the US health regulator the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an 'emergency use authorisation'.

The FDA gave it the green light on May 3, allowing laboratories across the US to use it even though it has yet to be formally approved.

Roche also announced that the blood sample kit was also granted the vital 'CE mark' that shows it is safe to use within the EU.

German officials already signed a deal at the beginning of May to buy five million of the Roche kits every month.

Roche said the amount of tests it would be able to make each month for the US and countries accepting the CE mark would be in the 'high double-digit millions'.

SO WHY HAS IT TAKEN THE UK SO LONG TO APPROVE ANY TEST?

Sir John Bell, an immunologist at Oxford University involved in evaluating antibody kits for the government, admitted approving tests takes 'longer than it should'.

He suggested officials wanted to be completely sure that the tests were accurate, telling BBC Radio 4 Today's programme: 'I think you have to be a bit cautious.'

Sir John accepted it has 'taken a week or two longer than it might have', while other experts have said 'every day counts' amid a pandemic.

But he pointed out the failure of DIY antibody tests, which were described as 'terrific' and offered hopes of a way out of lockdown - but none turned out to work.

Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: 'In the grand scheme of things, 11 days would be nothing.'

But he added that 'when you are in a situation like this when every day counts, it is indeed concerning'.

HOW ACCURATE IS THE TEST?

As long as it is used at least 14 days after someone has developed symptoms, it has a 100 per cent sensitivity rate, Roche claims.

Sensitivity is the rate of all positive samples that are truly positive. For example, if a test has an accuracy rate of 99 per cent, it means 99 out of every 100 people who test positive have actually been infected.

The other one person, however, would have been given an inaccurate result - known as a false negative result.

The Roche test also has a 'specificity' of 99.8 per cent, meaning it generates very few 'false positives' - when it indicates someone has been infected when they have not.

For every thousand people who take the test only two will be given a false positive result, according to its claim.

Sensitivity is considered the area authorities can afford to compromise on because testing errors in that area lead to false negatives – people being told they haven't had the disease when they actually have – which would lead to relatively few consequences for most.

False positives, however, caused by poor specificity, may lead people to believe they are immune when they're not, causing their behaviour to become riskier, or to receive treatment that they don't need.

HOW COME THIS ONE WORKS WHEN OTHERS HAVE FAILED?

Roche scientists have managed to develop a test that only picks up the virus that causes COVID-19, scientifically known as SARS-CoV-2.

Previous tests assessed struggled to differentiate COVID-19 antibodies from four other types of human coronaviruses which cause the common cold.

The body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses and infections, including other coronaviruses.

But independent experts have also called for transparency over the results, which haven't been made publicly available.

Professor Carl Heneghan, from Oxford University, said: 'Without seeing the study methods and the data it's impossible to verify these claims of accuracy.'

Professor Sheila Bird, a bio-statistician at Cambridge University, also called on the government to reveal the study design to allow scientists to scrutinise the work.",15,Low,Right

Simon Case, has been made permanent secretary at No 10 following almost two years working as William's right hand man.

The 41-year-old mandarin has strong previous experience at the heart of politics, having been a senior adviser to both Theresa May and David Cameron.

His appointment comes amid reports of a 'tense' stand-off between Boris Johnson and Sir Mark Sedwill, the head of the Civil Service, over the confusing plans for easing of the lockdown.

Last week Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chairman of the Defence Select Committee, said Sir Mark should stand down as Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service to focus on coordinating the nation's coronavirus response.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'Simon is working on the coronavirus response in No 10 as a permanent secretary. Simon is with us temporarily from the Royal household.'

'He is specifically co-ordinating the coronavirus response. Coronavirus is obviously a very significant piece of cross-Government work.'

Mr Case will report to Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the spokesman said.

He served as principal private secretary to David Cameron when he was Prime Minister and his successor Theresa May during 2015-17.

Before he began working for William, in July 2018, he was Director General Northern Ireland and Ireland in the Department for Exiting the EU.

The duration of Mr Case's secondment will be agreed between the Cabinet Office and the Royal Household.

Some MPs believe Sir Mark is spread too thinly, especially given the current pressures associated with dealing with the deadly outbreak.

But Mr Ellwood was the first senior MP to break cover and openly ask for him to stand down.

He said the coronavirus crisis is placing 'untold demands on all governments well beyond the routine' and that decision-making processes therefore needed to adapt.

The Prime Minister and Sir Mark are said to have had a 'tense' standoff when the plans to ease restrictions were being discussed at a meeting earlier this month.

Mr Johnson apparently asked the room who was responsible for actually implementing the measures contained within the blueprint.

He asked Sir Mark if it was him, but the head of the Civil Service replied it was up to the PM to make sure things happen.

The claims came amid reports of growing splits between ministers and senior civil servants.

The record plunge of 18.1 per cent month-on-month underlines the massive hit to the economy from coronavirus chaos.

Full lockdown was imposed by the government on March 23, with non-essential shops ordered to shut.

In the first full month after the draconian curbs were introduced, clothing sales volumes were hit by a 50.2 per cent drop - having already seen a fall of 34.9 per cent in March. Meanwhile, fuel saw a 52 per cent reduction, and food sales were down as the stockpiling frenzy eased, according to official figures.

One of the few areas to see an increase was off-licence sales, which were up 2.3 per cent on the month - perhaps reflecting the inability of Britons to go to pubs and bars.

Retail sales volumes dropped by nearly a fifth overall in April, with fuel down 52 per cent, according to official figures

The April drop followed the previous fall of 5.2 per cent in March compared to February.

The volume of goods sold by household stores fell 45.4 per cent, on the back of an 8.7 per cemt drop from February to March.

The proportion spent online rose to 30.7 per cent in April, the highest on record, up from 19.1 per cent over the same month last year.

Almost all store types saw record online spending in April, the ONS said, as many retailers shifted to online-only trading.

The only sectors to see an increase in volume of sales last month were non-store retailing such as online and catalogue businesses, up 18 per cent on the previous month, and off licences.

Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: 'The effects of Covid-19 have contributed to a record monthly fall in retail sales of nearly a fifth.

'Fuel and clothing sales fell significantly while spending on food also dropped after the surge from the panic buying seen last month. Off-licence sales, however, continued to increase.

'Online shopping has again surged as people purchased goods from their homes.'

Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said: 'The UK's first full month of lockdown measures exposed a sharp divide in retail, not only between those in food and non-food, but also between online and in-store sales as physical shops closed.

'Food sales volumes have fallen this month, down 4.1 per cent, as initial consumer stockpiling eased and supply chains caught up with the increased demand.

'However, in a significant jump, online food sales now account for 9.3 per cent of all food sales, testament to the ability of supermarkets to pivot supply chains and boost their online platforms to manage more home deliveries.'",15,Low,Right

Premier League clubs returned to training in small groups this week, although Watford boss Pearson’s plans have been hit by a series of complications.

Defender Adrian Mariappa and two members of staff recorded positive results in the first tests and three others are thought to have opted out of training for personal reasons, including captain Troy Deeney, who cited concerns about the health of one of his children.

Nigel Pearson revealed that two more Watford players have been forced into isolation

‘We’ve had several players not available for different reasons,’ said Pearson, after Watford extended a private testing programme to the families of players and staff and discovered this ruled out two more, which means six of his squad are absent.

‘One player through testing positive, two more because they’ve been in close contact with somebody else — even though their own tests came back negative — and we have the players who decided not to come in. That shows the complications we’ve got. I don’t intend to reveal names.’

Watford’s players and staff were tested for a second time on Friday, with the number of individual tests increased from 40 to 50, and have been told to expect the results this weekend.

Troy Deeney and three others have opted out of returning to training due to the risks involved

There are plans to test again on Monday and have the results back before the Premier League meet on Wednesday to discuss the next step of Project Restart.

The aim is to be playing again within four weeks.

‘Possibly,’ said Pearson (below) when asked if he expected this timescale to be accurate, but he warned of problems, including an increase in muscle injuries when players step up training to full contact.

He added: ‘I find it awkward to talk about football when we’ve got so many fatalities.

‘We’re working towards playing again. But it’s got to be timed right and done for the right reasons. You can’t compromise people’s health. That is a concern for some players and I respect their views.’

One of the fears among players is that those from black and ethnic minority backgrounds may be more vulnerable to coronavirus.

‘They still don’t have enough assurances,’ said Pearson, who has taken his own precautions by moving his 86-year-old father out of the family home in South Yorkshire, having moved him in at the start of the lockdown.

Adrian Mariappa tested positive for coronavirus this week along with two members of staff

‘I’m back at work and my circle of contact has gone from five or six to about 50. It’s no longer safe for my dad to be living with us. So, he’s gone home.

‘The most important thing for me is the health of myself and my family. Am I at greater risk by coming back to work? Probably yes, a bit. Do I feel safe at work? We’re taking every precaution we can and the players and staff have been fantastic this week.’

Meanwhile, Premier League chief Richard Masters has said crowds of fans turning up at stadiums when football resumes is ‘a concern’.

Masters said the Premier League wants ‘to play out the season as much as possible at home and away venues’ and added: ‘We’re talking to the authorities about that. But I believe we can appeal to fans not to congregate outside grounds.’

He also recognises the need for ‘contingency plans’ and said ‘curtailment is still a possibility’, meaning the season would be stopped.",15,Low,Right

FOOTBALL

Premier League officials had hoped to resume the current season behind closed doors on June 8, but that date has become impossible in recent weeks.

Talks between clubs, managers, players, medical staff, the government, the PFA and the LMA have dragged on and it took until last Monday to decide that non-contact group training could resume.

The majority of clubs are in favour of completing the campaign, although the use of neutral venues and the topic of relegation slowed down plans for Project Restart.

That sticking point now seems to have been resolved, with clubs almost certain to use their own stadiums for games and the format of the league staying the same.

The government have supported the return of live matches and believe it will help boost the mood of the nation with lockdown measures still likely to be in place to some extent.

However, with managers insisting their players need at least a month of training to get up to full fitness, it appears the start date will be pushed back until later in June.

A number of dates have been mooted, with June 20 or June 26 the most likely as players gear up for a return to contact training, potentially as early as next week.

Sky Sports and BT Sport will continue to broadcast games in the UK, while a large number of fixtures could also be aired for free following government intervention.

Elsewhere in England, the EFL are said to planning to resume the Championship season on June 20. The majority of clubs in League One want to end the season early, while the League Two campaign and all Scottish football has already been cancelled.

'I am confident that there is no other major sport which can meet health and safety criteria on isolation and social distancing as stringently as snooker can, so we are able to return more quickly than others.'

The Marshall Arena has been selected as there is accommodation on site, allowing for players to remain isolated throughout their participation in the event, which will be shown on ITV4.

The promoter told Sportsmail all about his intention to stage fight nights on four consecutive Saturdays in the 15-acre grounds of his Matchroom headquarters in Brentwood, Essex.

His £1million plan is to open with the all-Brit world title clash between Terri Harper and Natasha Jonas in mid-July, before closing with Dillian Whyte's WBC interim heavyweight title fight against Alexander Povetkin in the first or second Saturday in August.

The proposal, which involves having only 90 people on site per event, will see four cards of five fights each spread across a 28-day stretch.

Matchroom Fight Camp, as it is likely to be known, will be broadcast live on Sky Sports. Discussions are ongoing with the British Boxing Board of Control, Brentwood council and the WBC sanctioning body.

Hearn told Sportsmail: 'Financially this will be painful for us but after the momentum we have worked so hard to build over the past 10 years, I'm not going to let boxing just dribble back. While other guys go with arenas and empty studios, ours will look very different.

'Just imagine it. It is summer, the house is all lit up, you can see Canary Wharf in the distance and fireworks are going off. Then over the hill walk Dillian Whyte and Alexander Povetkin for a massive tear up on my lawn.

'World championship boxing in my garden? Oh, go on then.'

RUGBY

Hopes of the Premiership season resuming in July suffered a blow this week after clubs were forced to delay their return to training.

Sportsmail revealed that concerns about medical support including CPR provision, and doubts about the ability to fund a coronavirus testing programme, have forced impacted the schedule.

The setback raises fears the season won't be completed. On Thursday, a conference call meeting of the Professional Game Board, including representatives from the RFU, Premiership Rugby, the RPA players' union and the Championship clubs, confirmed that players cannot resume group activities for at least a fortnight.

Players are privately resigned to the shutdown dragging on far longer and possibly leading to the cancellation of the disrupted domestic campaign.

If that proves to be the case and Premiership officials stick to their regular rugby calendar, it could be October before we see any games played.

Meanwhile, Super League clubs hope to resume their season in August and have set an ambitious target of playing in front of fans again as soon as October.

The competition was suspended in March, but three plans have now been drafted by the 12 teams, paving the way for a restart.

Each version concludes with a Grand Final – in November, December or January respectively – and with final standings based around 22, 24 or 28 matches depending on the model. The plans are due to be formally submitted for consideration by the Rugby Football League next week.

The proposed return date of August 16 is seen as crucial to minimise any rebate due to Sky Sports, which holds broadcast rights through to the end of the 2021 campaign, but there is also a clear willingness to bring fans back as well as fixtures.

October 1 is the stated date for the earliest possible opening of the turnstiles, though as with the rest of the details that remains dependent on government guidance, health advice and the wider societal spread of Covid-19.

CRICKET

Cricket received a boost on Thursday as some England players began returning to socially distanced training for the first time since lockdown began.

The ECB now have increased hope of scheduling the majority of their international fixtures this summer with Pakistan and Australia saying they are ready to travel and fulfill their fixtures, although no matches will be played before July 1.

The West Indies are due to arrive on these shores first, pending a governmental green light and final agreement on health and safety protocols, while Cricket Ireland has already offered to be as flexible as possible to see three one-day internationals take place later this year.

In between, Pakistan and Australia are scheduled to visit for a series of high-profile fixtures.

Next week the ECB will announce its schedule and venues for England's 2020 summer, with the Ageas Bowl and Emirates Old Trafford set to be confirmed as its new behind-closed-doors centres barring any last-minute hitches.

Meanwhile, the ECB hopes the T20 Blast competition can be played this summer after the inaugural season of The Hundred was cancelled.

Northants have revealed that they are hopeful of playing matches in front of reduced crowds of 1,500 providing they are given the green light by authorities.

All 18 first-class counties are currently in talks with the ECB over how and when they can return to training safely.

FORMULA ONE

The Formula One calendar has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis, but there are finally plans to begin the season in Austria in July.

The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, which is still scheduled for July, remains up in the air, however, with officials concerned over the UK's coronavirus rules.

F1 bosses continue to talk to the highest levels of Government in the hope of brokering an 11th-hour agreement to win the sport an exemption over controversial plans to impose a 14-day quarantine period on travellers arriving in the UK.

The Prime Minister is being informed of developments and will make the final call.

If the exemption is not forthcoming, the two races planned for Silverstone in July and August — the British GP and a second round to make up for time lost to coronavirus — will move to Hockenheim in Germany's Rhine Valley.

An F1 spokesman said: 'Quarantine would make it impossible to have a British Grand Prix this year. We would be travelling back to the UK on F1-only aircraft and all staff would be tested, making quarantine totally unnecessary.'

If races cannot be held at Silverstone this summer, they could be moved to later in the year once the quarantine restrictions are lifted.

However, there is a chance there could no grand prix held in Britain during 2020 if it cannot be squeezed into the sport's proposed 16-race calendar.

GOLF

The European Tour hopes to resume the season at the end of July in England as part of a four-tournament 'bubble', according to Golf Digest.

The magazine claimed that the British Masters, which is scheduled for July 30 to August, would be followed by three tournaments offering around £900,000 in prize money at Forest of Arden and Hanbury Manor in England, and Celtic Manor in Wales.

Golf returned in the US last weekend when Rory McIlroy was among four players who took part in a charity event in Florida. The PGA Tour will resume without fans on June 11 with the Charles Schwab Challenge in Texas.

The British Masters at Close House is set to be held during the same week as the World Golf Championship in Memphis, Tennessee. The following week is the PGA Championship, the first major of the year, in San Francisco.

The European tour has already has had nine tournaments postponed and eight cancelled because of the pandemic.

The Open, which was due to be played in July at Royal St George's in Kent, has been cancelled and will instead be hosted by the same venue next year.

HORSE RACING

The BHA have said the fact French racing has been forced to close tracks in Paris and in the east of the country should have no ramifications for the resumption of racing in Britain on June 1.

Racing's ruling body has steered clear of using overseas jurisdictions whose racing has either continued or resumed as evidence as to why British racing should return.

This week, a spokesman for the BHA said: 'Our proposal has always been that racing will be ready to return safely in Britain as soon as the UK Government permits the resumption of sporting events.

'Our plans are being developed with officials from Public Health England and will be in line with UK government policy. We are making good progress as we prepare for a resumption on June 1.'

Final Government approval for the return of British racing has yet to be received.

Racing returned in France on May 11 at Longchamp but the French Government backtracked when announcing on Tuesday that no track inside Red Zones of high COVID-19 infections rates can now race.

TENNIS

The only British events yet to be called off due to the coronavirus are the Murray Trophy in Glasgow in September and the season-ending ATP Finals, which are still set to take place at the O2 Arena in November.

Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since the Second World War in April, while a number of other events have also been scrapped.

The Fever-Tree Championships at Queen's and the Nature Valley International in Eastbourne were among the casualties, and the British Trophy Series has also been all but wiped out.

The 33-year-old defender tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week along with two non-playing members of staff after 748 tests were carried out across the Premier League.

But Pearson is confident Mariappa will make a swift recovery and return to training after being given the all clear.

Watford defender Adrian Mariappa has confirmed he's tested positive for the coronavirus

Pearson told Sky Sports News: 'When I saw him for the test last week, I was sitting in the car park chatting to players as he came past so I had a chance to touch base with most of them.

'He looks exceptionally well and feels very well himself so I think it's an example of how this virus can affect people in different ways.

'He's following the advice and recommendations and isolating for a week. His family are all okay as well. I have no doubts in his case he'll be fine when he comes back in.'

Watford manager Nigel Pearson has backed defender Mariappa to make swift recovery

Mariappa was informed of his positive test on Tuesday and now has to isolate away for a week before having a new test and potentially returning to training.

The defender admitted he was shocked to find out he had the virus, saying this week: 'I’ve not had any symptoms and I’ve felt as fit as ever, probably fitter because I’ve been working really hard. I’ve been following my training programme and I’ve not felt out of breath or ill, or anything.

'We’ve been fully monitored the whole time and the club have been able to track our distances and things. I’ve been really excelling in all of that and feeling great.

'It’s quite scary how you can feel absolutely fine and not really have left the house, and yet still get the virus. If it wasn’t for the fact I had gone back to training and had this test, then I’d never have found out that I had the virus and I would just be getting on with things as normal. That’s obviously quite a strange thought.'",15,Low,Right

The German top flight begins its second round of matches since the restart on Friday, after resuming behind closed doors last week. As in the Premier League, players and key staff at clubs are taking tests for Covid-19 twice a week.

England’s top division hopes to follow in the footsteps of the Bundesliga next month, with Project Restart looking at the weekend of June 19-20 as a possible date for the first round of games since the suspension. But there is significant unease among many players about the health risks of full-contact training and matches.

Wolfsburg defender Kevin Mbabu (right) thinks Premier League stars should not be concerned

Yet Mbabu, who had a difficult spell at Newcastle from 2013-17, believes there are few reasons for concern. He said: ‘The league tried to do everything to be perfect and have the risk [level at] zero. All the people who were at the stadium [tested] negative so the risk to get this virus was very low.

‘I didn’t even think about it. I trusted the authorities – and we have to, because otherwise we wouldn’t be playing right now.

‘We arrived for our game at Augsburg in two coaches and there were two changing rooms and then no crowd. The team was split up in the changing rooms.

The defender took to the pitch for his side in the first games back for the Bundesliga

‘In the past eight weeks we have trained very hard. It’s hard to train without games at the end of the week, it was a real relief to play again.

‘At the beginning of the match it felt very weird. Normally when you walk on the pitch there’s a lot of noise, fans cheering and there was just nothing, only echoes.

‘But after two or three minutes when you focus on your job, you don’t really pay attention. When you have motivation to win the game you just forget about the rest.’

Mbabu created Wolfsburg’s late winner, scored by Daniel Ginczek to seal a 2-1 victory, and admitted he nearly forgot to stick to social distancing rules in his joy at the goal.

Mbabu said once the match had got underway he forgot the strange situation and atmosphere

Players have been advised to limit physical contact to a minimum where possible, meaning a number of restrained celebrations.

He told the BBC’s World Football Programme: ‘When we scored my first reaction was to jump on the striker but then he said “Just be careful, watch out” and I did a fist bump and that was it.

‘When you score in the last minute there is even more emotion and happiness and we couldn’t celebrate like we wanted, but it’s not a big problem.’",15,Low,Right

Norwich did not conduct their tests until Tuesday because head coach Daniel Farke and several of the club’s German players did not return to England until Monday evening. They will receive their results on Wednesday with a view to resuming training on Thursday.

In an indication of potential teething problems with the testing procedure, Sportsmail has learned that staff at several clubs were sent away from their training grounds without being tested due to a shortage of kits.

In another complication, some clubs did not use their full allocation of 40 kits, with 12 of the initial batch yet to be used. The Premier League will increase the allocation of kits to 50 for each club in the next round of testing, which will take place on Thursday and on Friday, with the results to be published on Saturday afternoon.

The Premier League were not given the identity of the staff or players who tested positive because of data protection issues, but Burnley broke ranks on Tuesday night and other clubs may consider disclosing positive tests in the interests of transparency.

Burnley said of Woan, manager Sean Dyche’s No 2 and close friend: ‘Ian is asymptomatic and is currently safe and well at home. He will remain in close communication with club personnel regarding his re-engagement in training once he is clear of the virus.’

After reports emerged on Tuesday, Watford confirmed their three positive tests but said in a statement: ‘All three have asked that medical confidentiality be respected and, therefore, the club will not be naming those involved.’

While cautious of getting ahead of themselves and unwilling to comment publicly, most clubs are satisfied with the first round of testing, and relieved that with just 0.8 per cent of tests being returned positive, there does not appear to be a mass outbreak among players.

The figures are broadly comparable to those in Germany, where there were 10 positives from 1,748 tests across the top two divisions when their players resumed training last month. Prenetics, the Hong Kong-based biotechnology company that is conducting the testing for the Premier League, claim the tests are 98.8 per cent accurate.

The UK has been in lockdown since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic with measures only slightly relaxed last week as the daily number of deaths continues to fall.

Thomas, who revealed he was HIV positive back in September, admitted the word 'virus' and 'disease' is still a trigger for him and that it has been particularly hard hearing them on a daily basis with coronavirus understandably dominating the news.

Speaking on The Jeremy Vine Show via Zoom, he said: 'I'll admit the start of it was very, very difficult for me because for me anxiety is like a loss of control and that brings a huge amount of fear into my life. At the start of it I didn't feel like I was in control of my life.

'It went from one day to the next I suddenly felt this pressure I suppose of having to fill time, so I felt the pressure to get really fit or become a genius to do a jigsaw or learn to bake banana bread and some things that weren't me so I found that challenging and I was missing my family so I cried a lot.

The Wales rugby icon admitted he felt pressured to fill time during the lockdown

'I was obsessed with the news and I was obsessed with finding out more about coronavirus so that brought a lot of fear into my life as well.

'I am somebody who lives with HIV, which is a virus, and yet I hear someone say disease and that's a word that really scares me, really discriminatley.

'You look at the tabloids and they are calling it different things, they are calling it a virus, a disease or an illness and they are all trigger words which to me - someone who is very anxious and very afraid anyway - it heightened my senses and heightened my fear.'

The 45-year-old was speaking to Jeremy Vine via a Zoom call on his show this week

'I don't take pleasure out of knowing people are in worse circumstances than mine. People say you know: ""It could be worse, you could be so and so down the road"".

'When I was asked the question by Patrick - ""Would you play if you had tested positive?"" - I ummed and ahhed and said ultimately yes.

'At that time, when Patrick was asking me the question, I was putting myself as a player, locked in the manager's room, putting me under pressure to play.

'I was thinking of myself and my family. What I wasn't thinking of was the bigger picture where possibly, if I had played and I was infected, I could have infected someone else.

The club held concerns that Rashford would have been ruled out for the rest of the campaign - but the England international has fought his way back into contention during the sport's suspension.

And as part of the Premier League's ambitious Project Restart proposals, top-flight stars will undergo Covid-19 tests ahead of a return to training.

Pereira has shed light on United's plans for a return to training earlier this month, with stars initially set to gear up for the season's restart in small groups.

He told Globo Esporte: 'We had a meeting and were told that if everything is going well, we'll be back in training on May 18 in groups of six. If that goes well, a week or two later, we'll be able to train as a group.

'There will be six players training initially and there won't be much contact between us. We'll still be separated and training in different parts of the pitch. Those precautions have to be followed.

'I don't know who'll be in my group yet.'

And boss Solskjaer revealed last week that he anticipates being able to select from a fully-fit squad, with the campaign set to resume in mid-June.

'Of course we're trying to improve all the time, develop as a team, and now we've got a full squad to choose from, and hopefully we've been looking after ourselves in the two months that we've been out,' he said.

'We just have to play it by ear and hope they click early. But let's get back to training first and then hopefully we can play soon.'

It comes after manager Steve Bruce expressed concerns over Project Restart which would see Premier League matches return in mid-June.

Further details of Project Restart were revealed to the 20 top-flight managers during a video conference call on Wednesday last week and there remains a strong desire to finish the season.

The Premier League is working towards a rough restart date of either June 12 or June 19, however Bruce fears his squad will need more time to reach full match fitness.

Newcastle are among Premier League clubs hoping to play on amid coronavirus pandemic

He told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Phase one will be mainly fitness work, four or five players on a pitch. Let's see how we get on.

'They have had eight weeks off and that is probably the longest break some of these players have had in their careers.

'If we're doing pre-season, we would have six weeks and probably have six friendly games to get them ready for the first league match.

Newcastle manager Steve Bruce has suggested Premier League players won't be fit enough to restart the season in mid-June and Project Restart needs to be pushed back three weeks

'So, we need a good stretch of time here to get them ready. Certainly once we get into stage two, that is vitally important.

'We need enough preparation to get these players into shape or they are just going to fall down like a pack of cards. Most of the manager have the same concerns.

'We would need at least six weeks. I don't see how we can play games until the back end of June.'",15,Low,Right

Boris Johnson may have 'lost his edge' and not yet fully recovered from his personal battle with coronavirus, a leading Tory MP warned today.

As the Prime Minister faced increasing criticism of his handling of the pandemic his mental sharpness was questioned from within his own party.

They expressed concern that in any other situation he would have been taking it easy and taking a much slower return to the vigours of work.

It came as a Nobel Prize-winning scientist tore into Mr Johnson's leadership, claiming it was not clear 'who is actually in charge of the decisions'.

Sir Paul Nurse said Britain has been left on the 'back foot' with a lack of clear planning that left it ''firefighting through successive crises', in a scathing attack on the political establishment.

Priti Patel says EVERYONE arriving in UK will be ordered to self-quarantine for 14 days from June 8 Priti Patel today confirmed all travellers returning to the UK from June 8 will face a mandatory 14 day period in quarantine as she said Britain must now guard against importing cases of coronavirus. The Home Secretary said the UK needed to protect the 'hard won progress' it has made in the fight against the deadly disease and that tough border controls will help to prevent a 'devastating resurgence'. Everyone coming into the country from abroad will now have to give an address and phone number to public health officials setting out where they will be self-isolating. Those officials will then be carrying out spot checks, with anyone found to be breaking rules facing an initial fine of £1,000 with further non-compliance resulting in unlimited fines. Any foreign national who declines to comply with the measures at the border could be refused entry. Ms Patel said a 'reckless minority' would not be allowed to undermine the UK's efforts to stop the spread of the disease. Critics immediately demanded to know why the border controls, which will be reviewed every three weeks, had not been introduced earlier in the crisis as Ms Patel faced accusations of having been 'too slow to act'.

Sir Paul's intervention came as the Government faces increasing pressure over its handling of the pandemic. Pinch points includes the rate of deaths in care homes, a decision to abandon widespread testing early on and the slow roll out of a new testing regime.

Last night Mr Johnson was forced to u-turn over a widely unpopular decision to make foreign NHS and care staff pay a surcharge to access healthcare in the UK, while working to save British lives.

A senior Tory MP told MailOnline: 'Under normal circumstances he would probably have been taking it easier. The guy was close to death… there was pressure on him to come back. People don't usually come back to the pressure that he has been under.

'He is back in the firing line, running UK plc with 67million people and all the problems that is has got.'

For most workers colleagues would ensure they were 'out of the door at 5.20pm latest and make sure he has his weekends off', the Tory said.

'Boris has lost that edge. You could say Boris, we need you to take a really difficult turn, and he would use his common sense and get out of it.

'The illness may have had an impact. The spontaneity... I wonder whether mentally he's not as sharp because he's been seriously ill.'

The PM is also coming under increasing scrutiny for a lack of public appearances, interviews and press conferences since his return to work from his coronavirus hospitalisation.

He has taken just one of the daily news conferences in Number 10, on May 11, with other ministers taking charge, including Home Secretary Priti Patel tonight.

Sir Paul Nurse said Britain has been left on the 'back foot' with a lack of clear planning that left it ''firefighting through successive crises', in a scathing attack on the political establishment.

The geneticist, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2001, criticised the PM (pictured last night), telling the BBC's Today Programme: 'I'm not completely convinced that we are actually being quite clear in having good leadership'

Apart from his address to the nation on May 10, his only other visible public appearances have been two underwhelming performances at Prime Minister's Questions.

But this afternoon he did finally agree to face MPs' questions next week with an appearance at the Commons' Liaison Committee.

The MP said they still thought the PM would emerge from the situation, suggesting any government would be under fire at this point. 'We are on a sticky wicket. You don't have to look too much under the surface to find things to be critical about,' they said.

The future of 'spoons: Boss Tim Martin reveals plans to REOPEN 875 pubs JD Wetherspoon today revealed its £11million masterplan to reopen its 875 pubs as soon as the Government gives them the nod in July - but while the blueprint promises social distancing there is no mention of the two-metre rule experts say will decimate the hospitality sector. Drinkers will be told 'not to meet in large groups' and will be expected to sanitise their hands on arrival and at other times during their visit. They will follow one-way systems to the toilets and through the bar where the tills will be screened off to protect staff likely to be wearing masks, gloves and eye protection, the chain said. Staff will hand over all drinks holding the base of the pint or wine glass and when ordered via a smartphone they will be delivered to the table on a tray for the customers to take themselves to reduce the chances of spreading Covid-19. Families will be asked to keep children seated and always accompanied to the toilet. The 875 pubs in UK and Ireland will open during its usual hours of 8am to around 1am and encourage customers to order using its app with posters put up telling them 'there is no need to visit the bar'. But people can pay by cash or card at the till if necessary and must not move any furniture

But they warned that Sir Keir Starmer had been making headway in the Commons. 'It is going down well. We need to be careful. Keir is a savvy guy. He can think on his feet,' the MP said.

Sir Paul, the chief executive of the distinguished Francis Crick Institute, said the country had been 'increasingly playing catch-up' and scientists and politicians should lay out 'a much clearer publicly-presented strategy' to tackle the pandemic.

The geneticist, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2001, told the BBC's Today Programme: 'I'm not completely convinced that we are actually being quite clear in having good leadership.

'The question I keep asking myself is: Do we have a proper Government system in here that can combine tentative knowledge, scientific knowledge, with political action?

'And the question I'm constantly asking myself is: Who is actually in charge of the decisions? Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy?

'Is it ministers? Is it Public Health England? The National Health Service? The Office for Life Sciences, Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies)? I don't know, but more importantly, do they know?'

Last night another top scientist claimed thousands of lives could have been saved from Covid-19 if Britain's lockdown was imposed just one week earlier.

Government scientific adviser Sir Ian Boyd, a member of Number 10's SAGE panel, admitted 'it would have made quite a big difference' if ministers acted sooner to fight the outbreak.

Department of Health figures show 36,042 Brits have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, which began to rapidly spread in the UK in March.

The Government is expected to unveil a new quarantine scheme today that forces anyone entering the UK to isolate for 14 days.

And so-called coronavirus 'immunity certificates' that could allow Britons to return to work have come a step closer after ministers announced that mass antibody tests are being deployed.

NHS and care workers will start to be given the tests from next week after Matt Hancock announced the government has signed a contract for 10 million kits.

The screening will finally show who has been through the disease and emerged with some level of resistance, a blind spot that has so far been a major blow to the UK response.

Asked about the country's approach to the outbreak on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Paul said: 'I'm not sure we are quite getting it right.'

Sir Paul added: 'Everybody involved, not just the politicians, the scientists and the doctors, we're all making mistakes and we have to try and learn from what mistakes have been made up until now.

'I get a sense the UK has been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting through successive crises.'

He suggested that what was needed was to 'get a much clearer publicly-presented strategy as to what we're actually trying to do, and the evidence upon which it is based'.

Sir Paul added: 'And we're not getting that in communications. Maybe there's a strategy there, I don't see it.'

Detailed statistics show that more than 44,000 people have already died with COVID-19 in the UK, but a study from the University of Southampton suggested that number could have been kept to 11,200 if lockdown was introduced earlier

Asked about the use of quarantine, Sir Paul suggested more evidence was needed about the infectiousness of people with coronavirus and how this was revealed through symptoms.

Australia pushes to be first country exempted from UK's new 14-day quarantine rules as arrivals face 'spot checks' on homes Australia is pushing to be the first country exempted from the UK's new 14-day coronavirus quarantine - as arrivals face 'spot checks' on homes and £1,000 fines for breaking the rules. Ministers are due to unveil plans for mandatory isolation of everyone coming into the country, in a bid to stop the deadly disease flaring up again. Those who flout the orders face £1,000 fines, followed by even tougher penalties if the they fail to pay. Arrivals will be required to supply an address where they will be isolating, enforced by public health officers carrying out random visits. Exemptions from the tough regime will be extremely limited to start with, mainly covering lorry drivers, NHS workers and fruit pickers considered essential to run the economy and health services. Free movement with Ireland will also be maintained, with the Common Travel Area a key part of the peace deal. The system is not expected to be finalised until the Commons returns from recess at the beginning of next month. However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has already raised the prospect of 'air bridges' to low-infection countries being introduced at a later stage. Reports in Australia suggest PM Scott Morrisson is pushing for his country, which has almost wiped out the virus, to be left out of the curbs.

He said: 'Because for a long time it's been clear that people without symptoms can be infected and therefore be infectious to other people and yet in the hospitals and in the care homes we haven't been testing such people.

'So we have been allowing people, care workers, to be in the ward, who are potentially infected, infecting patients, infecting themselves, and as a consequence making hospitals potentially unsafe places to be.

'We have to see a changed strategy there that is reliant upon the real evidence.'

He continued: 'I don't see clarity in the public sphere about these sorts of arguments that need to be shown to the public so that they feel actually they are safe when they go to hospital.'

Sir Paul said there was 'another mistake' when the testing strategy was put in place.

He said: 'There were many laboratories around the country, smaller laboratories, that could have got a major, major increase in testing capacity much more quickly than was possible with the big labs.'

Sir Paul said he did not think there should be a formal inquiry into the UK's response to the outbreak now, but more 'openness' was needed, alongside a 'greater debate in the public domain'.

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he 'wouldn't agree' with Sir Paul's criticism, explaining that the Government has followed 'the best advice that is out there'.

He said: 'I think what we have seen through this actually is we as a Government have been very clear with people, very transparent with people.

'The Prime Minister himself has been very clear - the Prime Minister ultimately is responsible.

'We do follow the best advice that is out there from both the scientific advisers, our chief medical advisers and the teams there but ultimately it is the ministers who make decisions.

'And I think that is one of the things we have seen throughout this process, is our working to ensure we get as much information to people as we can to ensure that people understand what we can all do to play our part in keeping the R level down.'

Thousands of lives could have been saved if Britain imposed lockdown a WEEK earlier than March 23, claims government scientific adviser

Sir Ian Boyd, a member of Number 10's SAGE panel, admitted 'it would have made quite a big difference' if ministers acted sooner to fight the outbreak

Thousands of lives could have been saved from Covid-19 if Britain's lockdown was imposed just one week earlier, a government scientific adviser has claimed.

Sir Ian Boyd, a member of Number 10's SAGE panel, admitted 'it would have made quite a big difference' if ministers acted sooner to fight the outbreak.

Department of Health figures show 36,042 Brits have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, which began to rapidly spread in the UK in March.

But the true number of Covid-19 victims is feared to be closer to the 60,000-mark, when suspected and indirect deaths are taken into account.

Sir Ian's claim comes after research this week claimed triggering the UK's lockdown a week earlier would have saved tens of thousands of lives.

The shock study suggested enforcing strict rules to fight the coronavirus crisis on March 16 could have limited the number of deaths to 11,200.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent the country into lockdown on March 23, 60 days ago, banning people from meeting up with others or making unnecessary trips.

Britain was one of the last countries in Europe to put the rules in place - Germany, Belgium, France, Spain and Italy had done it days or weeks earlier.

WHEN DID OTHER COUNTRIES GO INTO LOCKDOWN AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THEM? An report published in March by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team outlined the dates on which various countries in Europe started their lockdown measures. Each is listed below, alongside the COVID-19 death toll for each country, as of May 20. The numbers on their own do not suggest a direct link between the timing of lockdown and the number of people who died, showing that other factors come into play. The most comparable countries in size to the UK are France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Austria: March 16; 633 deaths

Belgium: March 18; 9,150 deaths

Denmark: March 18; 561

France: March 17; 28.022

Germany: March 22; 8,193

Italy: March 11; 32,169

Norway: March 24; 233

Spain: March 14; 27,778

Sweden: No lockdown; 3,743

Switzerland: March 18; 1,883

United Kingdom: March 24; 35,341

Sir Ian, a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews, told The Coronavirus Newscast: 'Acting very early was really important.

'I would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate.

'And I think that's really the number one issue - could we have acted earlier? Were the signs there earlier on?'

He said the UK, as well as some of its European counterparts, were 'slower off the mark' than nations that had battled SARS in the early 2000s.

SARS, caused by another type of coronavirus, infected 8,000 people worldwide and killed 774 people in a year in 2002.

Sir Ian added: 'One could point the finger at ministers and politicians for not being willing to listen to scientific advice.

'You could point the finger at scientists for not actually being explicit enough. But at the end of the day all these interact with public opinion as well.

'And I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasn't feasible because people wouldn't have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did.'

The membership of the secretive SAGE committee which has been advising the Government on its handling of coronavirus was finally made public earlier this month.

A TIMELINE OF THE UK'S COVID-19 LOCKDOWN February 28: Virus started spreading uncontrollably in Britain, according to the World Health Organization. March 3: Government and NHS officially launched campaign urging people to wash their hands more often. March 12: Anyone who developed a fever or a new cough, regardless of whether they got tested for COVID-19, was told to self-isolate for two weeks. March 16: Social distancing begins: Public were told to avoid contact with people outside of their homes, to work from home where possible, and to only take essential travel, such as to and from work or medical appointments.

Pubs and restaurants are not forced to close but people are encouraged to avoid them.

Likewise, the Government refused to ban large gatherings and sports events but said police and ambulances would no longer be provided for them. March 20: Major businesses were ordered to close immediately, including gyms, leisure centres, pubs, cafes, restaurants, theatres and cinemas. March 23: Full lockdown introduced: In a speech to the nation Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to stay at home unless necessary, only leaving to shop, to go to medical appointments or to exercise once per day.

Gatherings of people were banned, regardless of size, and people prohibited from mixing with others outside of their household.

Everyone was told to work from home if possible. Many non-essential workers were forced to stop working if they couldn't do it from home.

Schools shut their doors except to the children of essential workers. March 24: All non-essential businesses, including clothing shops and hairdressers, were ordered to close.

The names of those who sit on the panel had not previously been published on security and independence grounds.

But officials bowed to mounting pressure and released the names of 50 experts across many fields who have sat in regular meetings during the pandemic.

The names on the list included well-known figures who have been involved in the daily press conferences, including chairman Sir Patrick Vallance.

It also included Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and his deputies Dr Jenny Harries and Professor Jonathan Van Tam.

Others present were epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson and Dr Demis Hassabis, the chief executive of Google's DeepMind subsidiary.

Dr John Dagpunar, from the University of Southampton, echoed Sir Ian's claims in shock research published earlier this week.

He said in his paper: 'Literally, each day's delay in starting lockdown can result in thousands of extra deaths.'

Dr Dagpunar, a mathematical sciences expert, added: 'It does pose the question as to why lockdown did not occur earlier?'

He predicted how different scenarios may have affected the progress of the Covid-19 outbreak in Britain.

Starting the lockdown a week earlier on March 16 could have limited the number of deaths to 11,200, his analysis showed.

Dr Dagpunar's study considered the number of people infected with the virus, its rate of reproduction, hospital bed and staff capacity, and the proportion of patients who die, among other factors.

He calculated the death rate to be one per cent, and the pre-lockdown reproduction rate (R) to be 3.18, meaning every 10 patients infected a further 32.

The paper estimated that 4.4 per cent of all patients need hospital treatment, 30 per cent of whom will end up in intensive care.

Of the intensive care patients, a hospital stay lasts 16 days on average and half of them go on to die.

Of the other 70 per cent, a hospital stay averages eight days and 11 per cent die.

The study suggested that a lockdown which began a week earlier - on March 16 - would have led to a total of 11,200 people dying and just two per cent of the population catching the virus (98 per cent susceptibility)

A second model, which most closely aligns with what is happening in the UK right now, suggests that six per cent of the population get infected and around 39,000 people die. The demand for hospital beds is considerably higher than in the previous estimate. Britain is known to have more than 44,000 deaths already so this estimate is still too low

The study suggests that an earlier lockdown would have led to smaller peaks in deaths and demand for hospital beds

Dr Dagpunar's research showed a sharper, higher peak in deaths and demand for hospital beds in the UK's current situation, in which the lockdown began on March 23. The total death toll for this model (39,000) has already been exceeded, however

The Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, which has been advising the Government, estimated in March that the global average R0 of the coronavirus was 3.87. As social distancing and lockdown took effect that number has now plummeted to below 1, potentially as low as 0.5, meaning the virus will die out naturally if this continues

Experts suggested coronavirus was 'disappearing' from the UK, with deaths down and new cases in London below 50 a day

BUSINESS CHIEFS AND MPS CALL FOR QUICK LOCKDOWN EXIT Business leaders and politicians last night pleaded with the Government to unlock the economy and get Britain moving after figures appeared to show the Covid-19 outbreak was coming under control. Experts suggested coronavirus was 'disappearing' from the UK, with deaths down and new cases in London below 50 a day. Official figures revealed on Thursday how deaths, hospital admissions and new infections have dropped significantly since the epidemic peaked in early April. The R-rate – which shows how quickly the virus is spreading – is also said to be falling. Professor Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, said coronavirus was 'disappearing at a rate that's speeding up', and urged politicians to 'open up businesses' to prevent a second wave of deaths caused by economic collapse. Conservative former leader Iain Duncan Smith said: 'We need to move fast. The threat facing us now, outweighing coronavirus, is that of a failing economy.' Tory ex-minister John Redwood said: 'We are going to have unemployment on a scale not seen for many a year... unless we get furloughed people back to work.'

Running these factors through an algorithm based on the timing of the UK's outbreak, Dr Dagpunar suggested that the March 23 lockdown could have resulted in a total of around 39,000 deaths.

Britain is known to have passed this grim landmark number already, suggesting that the study's estimate of fatality rate, virus R rate, or another factor, is too low.

If lockdown had been started a week earlier, on March 16, the model suggested, there could have been a 'very large reduction' in deaths, limiting them to around 11,200.

The virus would have infected four per cent less of the population in this scenario (two per cent compared to six per cent), the study said, and the demand for hospital beds would have been lower.

Dr Dagpunar said: 'In hindsight [this] clearly illustrates that earlier action was needed and would have saved many lives.'

'Literally, each day's delay in starting suppression (lockdown) can result in thousands of extra deaths.

'The same is true for premature relaxation, acknowledging that the rate of decline is less than the rate of growth, so the effect although severe is not quite as strong.

'These conclusions are the incontrovertible consequence of the exponential growth and decline of a managed epidemic.'

Dr Dagpunar's paper was published on the website medRxiv without being checked by other scientists or journal editors.

Polls of Brits show around two thirds of people think the government took too long to put the UK in lockdown.

But other experts say ministers 'lost sight' of the evidence and rushed into lockdown, praising Sweden for holding its nerve and not shutting down the economy.

Surveillance studies have shown the crucial R rate had already began to drop before the draconian measures were introduced.

And other data suggested transmission had peaked after the softer social distancing measures to curb the outbreak were rolled out on March 16.",15,Low,Right

Biotech company Oxford Nanopore is working on a portable swab-recording device called LamPORE, which can determine whether a user has coronavirus in the space of an hour.

As well as being able to process around 30,000 samples a day, the device can also be used to determine whether hard surfaces in schools, hospitals and care homes have traces of COVID-19.

A new coronavirus mass-testing kit, which includes a portable testing device called LamPORE, (pictured) could be used by members of the public in just a matter of weeks. The device uses electronic means to analyse swab samples and can give back results in just over an hour

The company, who have validated the device internally, say that it could be used to check whether every single public service worker has the virus before they go off to work.

The LamPORE device, which also comes in a desktop version which is about the size of a printer, uses electronic means to record and analyse the samples.

Each test is given a barcode which is individually assessed before returning back with the result - without having to wait for swabs to be sent to the laboratory.

The portable version of the LamPORE device is believed to be the same size as a CD player.

Oxford Nanopore CEO Gordon Sanghera told Sky News: 'In the next six to eight weeks, we will be able to hit one million tests a month, and we can double that and double it again.'

The test was made by biotech company Oxford Nanopore, with the LamPORE test already passing inital tests within the centre (pictured)

'You have to be able to test in real time, or near real time, at the point of infection and close it down rapidly.

'So I think it's a game-changer.'

After passing the initial tests inside Oxford Nanopore, the device and the testing system is set for further checks before being shown to regulators.

Meanwhile, an antibody test is being prepared for public usage in South Wales, with Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, situated around 20 miles outside of Cardiff in Brigend, believed to be the only company currently working on this typing of test in the UK.

According to Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething, the test will be able to determine whether someone has previously had the virus in the past.

Meanwhile, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, a company based in South Wales, are the only firm in the UK working on an antibody test (pictured) which can tell if someone has had the virus in the past

Mr Gething said: 'It is important to say although the test can tell if someone has had the virus, it's not certain as to how much immunity they'll have to the virus.

'We are also looking to deliver another type of antibody test, which can give a result in minutes.

'Together with the test announced today, this will form an important part of our test, trace, protect to strategy to help Wales come out of lockdown.

'I will shortly be announcing how these antibody tests will fit into the strategy and when our critical workers and general public will be able to get access to them.'",15,Low,Right

GP Dr Manpinder Sahota, from Gravesend, Kent, said a paediatric consultant called him up and voiced their concerns to him after both children suffered non-Covid related deaths at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford.

Senior public health figures have repeatedly raised concerns about people not attending hospitals for non-coronavirus related conditions during the pandemic.

It comes as NHS statistics revealed April was the quietest month ever for A&E departments across England with only 916,581 emergency department visits recorded.

Priti Patel announced 351 more coronavirus deaths in Britain today, taking the official number of victims to 36,393.

Dr Manpinder Sahota, a GP from Gravesend, Kent, said a paediatric consultant called him up to say they were worried two children had died in the Dartford hospital because of a reluctance to going to hospital

Although the A&E admission figures appear to now be returning to normal levels, NHS England national medical director Stephen Powis stated there were concerns peoples' worries about the virus and not wanting to burden the NHS were forcing them to attempt to care for themselves instead of going to to hospital.

Dr Sahota, who works at Pelham Medical Centre, said he wanted to get the message out to the public that people should go to hospital if necessary, especially children 'because they are coming in very, very ill'.

Details regarding the two children's ages and why they were admitted to hospital are yet to be disclosed. They died at the hospital around three weeks ago.

The Mirror reported Dr Sahota said: 'Parents were actually frightened to bring their kids in and some of them are either dying at home or it’s too late when they do get to hospital.

'But hospitals have been cleaned and disinfected and all the Covid patients are separated – so the risk of catching it is not huge.

'There’s a lot of people who will be dead or dying, or have a poor prognosis as a result because of these non-Covid late presentations.'

The GP said he believes the number of non-coronavirus deaths will increase dramatically in the next three to six months.

He stated he estimates bookings to his surgery have dropped by two-thirds since the pandemic despite him trying to persuade patients to come in.

His patients reported they were too scared to come in to the surgery also resulting in a decrease in referrals, including cancer referrals.

During the crisis and subsequent lockdown, people have been avoiding hospitals out of fear of adding extra pressure to the NHS or catching the virus while they're in the hospital, doctors say.

A&E departments saw fewer visitors than ever in April but NHS spokesman Stephen Powis said levels were beginning to return to normal

Medics warn the massive change in behaviour is a 'ticking time bomb' which may result in more people ending up seriously ill or dying in the near future because they avoided getting medical help when they needed it.

Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents hospital doctors, said the drop in A&E attendances in April was 'a significant concern' and people's conditions may have worsened as a result.

'This is a ticking timebomb in itself and it will be exacerbated by a myriad of other pressures in the coming weeks,' he said.

'There will be an ongoing need to keep people with coronavirus separate from others to prevent transmission, with segregated wards effectively reducing immediately available beds, so attempting to manage increased demand will be very challenging.'",15,Low,Right

Boris Johnson has ordered civil servants to draw up a plan, code-named Project Defend, to beef up the UK's national security resistance to Beijing amid fury at the lack of warning it gave others of the outbreak.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will lead the scheme which includes identifying Britain's main economic vulnerabilities to potentially hostile foreign governments, according to the Times.

Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""The coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated the importance of resilient supply chains to ensure the continued flow of essential items and keep global trade moving.

""What we're looking at is what steps we can take to ensure that we have diverse supply chains in place to avoid shortages in the event of a future crisis.""

Department for International Trade permanent secretary Antonia Romeo is running the cross-Government project and reporting to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on the PM's behalf, the spokesman said.

It came as the Communist regime of president Xi Jimping was accused of acting like 'Mafia' drug dealers over coronavirus equipment supplies.

Tory Tom Tugundhat told Sky: 'We have already seen that China is buying up PPE … on the international market in order to increase dependence on Chinese suppliers.

'So like a drug pusher buying up the supply of its rivals in order to drive up the price of its own product, what this country is now doing is really gangster technology - they are priding themselves as being ''wolf warriors'' in embassies and the boardrooms, but actually it is a lot more Mafia than wolf.'

Downing Street has already set out that it wants a full international inquiry into how the coronavirus outbreak started in China, amid concerns president Xi is attempting to whitewash China's involvement in its origins.

Boris Johnson is also facing increasing pressure from the Tory backbenches and allies including the United States over a deal to allow Huawei to play a part in the UK's 5G information network.

Two working groups have been set up as part of the project, according to the report, with one source telling The Times that the aim was to diversify supply lines to no longer depend on individual countries for non-food essentials.

Johnson told lawmakers he would take steps to protect Britain's technological base, with the government review also expected to include personal protective equipment and drugs, the report added.

The development comes as Beijing has been tackling mounting international criticism over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which began in China before spreading to the rest of the world.

Mr Tugendhat this morning backed the idea of removing dependency, attacking China's 'colonial strategy' in areas like Africa where they 'are buying up large tracks of land and seeking to create very strong debt dependency'.

He added: It would certainly have an effect if we were looking at our own supply chains and actually moving them to countries we can reply on.

'That means getting out of deals with Huawei and doing deals instead with companies in Japan and South Korea who can be relied upon.'

Tory Tom Tugundhat told Sky China was acting like the Mafia over PPE supplies, hoarding them to drive up prices

Beijing has sought to turn the pandemic into a propaganda victory despite earlier public discontent about the government's handling of the crisis, with Xi declaring in March that the virus had been 'basically curbed'.

The central government has focused the blame for the pandemic's early spread on local officials in the hardest-hit Hubei province, while state media has played up the contrast between China's gradual return to normal life and continued chaos abroad in recent weeks.

But China's economy contracted for the first time in decades in the first quarter.

Beijing also faces suffering a blow to its international image, with the US seeking to point fingers at China for the pandemic that has infected nearly five million people around the world.

Addressing the World Health Organization's annual assembly on Monday, president Xi defended China's handling of the crisis and said Beijing supported a WHO-led 'comprehensive evaluation' of the global response after the pandemic is brought under control.

Beijing-backed crackdowns on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and the mass internment of Muslim minorities in the western Xinjiang region have also sparked an international backlash.",15,Low,Right

Speaking on FUBAR Radio the dancer, 31, also teased when the BBC show might be coming back to screens.

She said: 'Obviously everybody is just waiting to hear what's gonna happen. But I think the nation needs some sparkles of Strictly!

'I just know that everybody's working really, really hard to make it work. I think we'll need to wait and hear how the rules are going to change further on.

'We normally start at the end of July or beginning of August, so things might drastically change of course with the social distancing and things like that.

'But I really, really think we all need it!'

BBC Director of Content Charlotte Moore recently revealed producers are still assessing contingency plans such as enforcing a face mask rule, dancing two metres apart and even quarantining celebrities and professional dancers.

Celebration: As the show was celebrating it’s 200th episode, Katya, 31, had prepared a dance routine to Sophie Ellis Bextor’s Murder On The Dance Floor, which she taught to presenters Joanna and Stephen

Comparing the series to RuPaul's Drag Race during a virtual production meeting, BBC's director of content Charlotte Moore said: 'People think if it is a shiny floor it needs an audience and I don't think that's necessarily true.'

Earlier this month, insiders revealed to MailOnline that due to BBC executives 'not knowing what world we'll be in' when the show hits screens, they are keeping options open.

Despite reports claiming one option was to keep the celebrity and dance professionals in isolation together, sources insisted this was not plausible.

Katya has been keeping herself busy during lockdown by signing up as an NHS responder.

She explained: 'I live in quite a small town and there hasn’t been anything going on.

'Then today the alarm went off on my phone and I’m like, ''what’s going on? I don’t know what to do!''

'It was one of the patients. An elderly couple needed their medicine picking up from the pharmacy and taking to them and I was buzzing!'

She has also been learning new languages and helping her fellow professional dancers Karen Hauer and Oti Mabuse with their Home Festival.

The ballroom dancer also revealed that she wouldn't have had any days off until January next year if the nation hadn't gone into lockdown.

But the one thing Katya hasn't been doing during her newfound free time is dancing.

She explained: 'I live in quite a small town and there hasn’t been anything going on'

She said: 'Do you know what’s really funny? The one thing I haven’t done at all during the lockdown is dancing!

'I swear, I did one class, I led one class, and that’s it. I’ve not danced at all!'

As the show was celebrating it’s 200th episode, Katya had prepared a dance routine to Sophie Ellis Bextor’s Murder On The Dance Floor, which she taught to presenters Joanna and Stephen.

BBC insiders recently told MailOnline: 'Bosses are looking at contingency plans but just don't know where there'll be at. They don't know what world we'll be in.

'The international versions are running. Germany has no audience and are isolating but not in any kind of Big Brother style. Isolating individually then rehearsing.

'Strictly are looking at options. At this stage, there's no chance they could isolate as individuals or couples. That would leave any married or parent dancers not seeing their families for up to three months.

'At the moment, it's not being considered. No one knows where we'll be in the world - if the series is a much shorter run, say. The isolation is not something that's currently on the table.'

A BBC spokesperson said: 'We will continue to review all productions on a case by case basis and will continue to follow the latest news and advice from the Foreign Office, World Health Organisation and Public Health England.'

Bosses are also reportedly offering double fees to celebrities, with sources claiming TV executives are keen for the series 'to remain the jewel in the BBC's crown' and have already put forward contract proposals in a bid to attract a 'stellar line-up' for this year's upcoming series.

The consumer champion says its Consumer Insight Tracker shows that trust in airlines and holiday companies has dropped from a net score of nine in February 2020 to minus 12 in May 2020 – a drop of 21 points.

This is the lowest score ever recorded in the seven years that the data has been collected.

Trust in the travel industry has plunged to a record low, according to research by Which?

Which? surveyed over 2,000 people about their level of trust in airlines and holiday operators between May 13 and 15 - eight weeks after the UK’s lockdown grounded most international travel.

Net trust is calculated by subtracting the proportion of those that do not trust the industry from those that do, with a score below zero indicating a greater proportion do not trust the sector than do.

Just one in five (22 per cent) said they trust these industries, while 34 per cent said they did not trust them, giving a net score of -12.

This is in comparison to three in 10 (32 per cent) people saying they trusted the sectors in February – just shortly after the coronavirus outbreak began in the UK – and nearly a quarter (23 per cent) saying they did not trust airlines and holiday companies, giving a net score of nine.

Seven in 10 people surveyed by Which? who had booked a holiday or flight prior to the lockdown had some or all of their plans cancelled, with the majority (58 per cent) still waiting for their money to be returned to them.

Of those waiting for their money back for a cancelled trip, nearly half (47 per cent) have been left more than £500 out of pocket, and nearly three in 10 (27 per cent) are owed more than £1,000.

Under the Denied Boarding Regulations, if you’re due to fly with an airline based in the UK or EU, or are flying from an airport in the UK or EU, you’re protected if your flight is cancelled, and should be refunded within seven days.

For package holidays, the Package Travel Regulations state that customers whose holidays are cancelled by the operator in these circumstances should receive a full refund within 14 days of the cancellation.

Which? says it is only the second time since its records began that the net score for trust in airlines and holiday companies has dropped below zero.

Seven in 10 people surveyed by Which? who had booked a holiday or flight prior to the lockdown had some or all of their plans cancelled, with the majority (58 per cent) still waiting for their money to be returned to them

The only previous occasion net trust in the industry entered negative figures was briefly after the collapse of Thomas Cook in September 2019, when the net score decreased to -1 per cent.

Nearly a month ago, Which? claimed that all of the UK’s major airlines and holiday companies are openly breaking the law by delaying refunds for cancelled trips or removing customers’ refund rights altogether, as they face unprecedented strain due to the coronavirus crisis.

The industry’s own estimates at the time suggested that up to £7billion of travellers’ money is affected.

In that time, the government has confirmed there have been no changes to the law and that all customers are entitled to a cash refund – but Which? says it has taken no significant action to ensure consumers can access the refunds to which they are legally entitled.

Additionally, while the European Commission has since set out how member states can make Refund Credit Notes (RCNs) more appealing by ensuring they are financially protected, the UK government has yet to confirm if RCNs – which are being pushed as a viable alternative to cash refunds for package holidays by the industry body, Abta – are Atol protected.

Which? says this leaves customers who accept one at risk of losing their money should their holiday provider fail, adding further confusion to the situation around refund options.

The findings come on the same day as the UK’s aviation minister and the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, are due to face questions on the coronavirus’s impact on flights and travel from MPs on Parliament’s Transport Select Committee.

Which? is now warning that government intervention is essential to prevent any further damage to the industry, and has set out its recommendations in its 10-point plan, which it has shared with the government. It is calling on it to urgently support the industry to fulfil its legal obligations to its customers.

Which? says the government has taken no significant action to ensure consumers can access the refunds they are legally entitled to

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has announced it will be reviewing airlines’ handling of refunds during this crisis and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating cancellations and refunds for UK holiday accommodation. Now Which? is warning that the government and aviation regulator cannot delay taking action against airlines and holiday companies that it knows are breaking the law on refunds for any longer - otherwise trust in the sector will plummet further.

Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: 'These latest figures are a damning indictment of the behaviour of many airlines and holiday companies in recent weeks.

'With customers being told to either wait months for their money back or accept a voucher that may prove worthless if a company fails, it should come as a surprise to no-one that trust has plummeted so drastically.

'Any further delay risks permanent damage to trust in the travel industry. The regulator must come down strongly on any airlines found to be systemically denying or delaying refunds for cancelled flights and holidays, and the government must urgently set out how it will support the industry and restore trust in the sector.'",15,Low,Right

Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'This is a tough time for the travel industry. It's one of the sectors worst hit by coronavirus, but it's a tough time for the public too, many of whom are also in dire straits. And they've been strident in telling us that they'll remember how firms dealt with them during this time – good and bad.

'People aren't just judging on whether firms failed to give a refund – though that plays a big part. Many poor ratings are also about difficulties in getting in touch, being given the runaround, and terrible management of expectations – such as Ryanair sending vouchers to those who'd specifically requested cash refunds.

'People shouldn't be annoyed with firms offering to move bookings or offering vouchers as refunds. Indeed I'd encourage those who don't need the cash to take them, especially from firms with solid financials, as it'll help keep the industry going and keep people in work.

Ryanair came 47th in the poll. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'This is a tough time for the travel industry. It's one of the sectors worst hit by coronavirus, but it's a tough time for the public too'

'Yet when people are entitled to monetary refunds, to make them sit on phones on hold for hours, often getting cut off to get it, when vouchers are available at the click of a button leaves people feeling rightly riled.

'Sadly, out of the 53 companies rated, only 17 were net positive. Yet that means they should get even louder plaudits for trying to do it right.

'They're struggling, but are protecting customers too, and the likelihood is when this is all over, they'll come out stronger and with more brand loyalty because of it.'

MailOnline Travel asked Ryanair, TravelUp and Travel Trolley for a comment but did not receive a response.

Airbnb came third in the poll, which produced a ranking of firms each used by at least 100 respondents

FOUR QUICK TIPS TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK The exact process to follow if your booking is cancelled and you want to get your money back will vary depending on the type of booking you have (flight, hotel, package holiday and so on). Before asking for a cash refund, consider if you need one. At the moment, many firms are really struggling. This means it's safer to demand a refund rather than settle for a voucher, in case the firm collapses before you can use it. But it's also worth considering whether you're in a position to show forbearance. Having said that, if you're sure that you do in your money back, here are a few brief tips to follow: 1. Speak to the firm first and use its refund system. Always start this way. Give it a chance, use its systems. 2. If that fails, warn it you'll take it further. If you can speak to the firm and it isn't helping, warn it you'll speak to your card firm. This costs firms and it's cheaper if they do it themselves, so give them the chance. 3. If the firm won't give you money back, ask your card provider. Speak to your card provider and ask it to do a chargeback – where it asks the firm's bank for the money. 4. If this doesn't work, your final action would be to take the legal route, perhaps through a county court. Source: MoneySavingExpert.com.

Wayne Perks, Managing Director of Teletext Holidays, said in response to the survey result: 'Despite having to put the most of our UK team on furlough, and having halved the size of our operation in India, the remaining staff have been working non-stop with suppliers to cancel holidays and negotiate the waiving of any cancellation fees from them, as well as answering any communication we receive.

'We had to switch our phone lines off because the Indian government enforced a very strict lockdown in the cities where both our sales centres are located and we were unable to get staff into these offices. I can now advise that the restrictions are being eased and our sales centres are once again able to take calls, albeit at a reduced rate whilst social distancing is maintained. '

He added: 'When we book holidays for our customers, we immediately pay for the flights, and therefore do not retain any of this money within our business. In addition, Teletext Holidays often pays hotels in advance in order to get customers the best room rates.

'Teletext Holidays, therefore, acts as an agent and we are experiencing long delays in receiving monies back from airlines, with some telling us that we will not receive customers money until ""the virus has passed"".

'We have put in place a two-stage refund process, offering customers Atol protected refund credit notes which they can use up to December 31, 2020, for holidays travelling up to December 31, 2021. If they do not decide to take this option, we are offering full refunds from July 31, 2020.'",15,Low,Right

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said a 'blanket' 14-day quarantine rule for arrivals will be introduced from next month.

But he disclosed that there are 'active discussions' going on over what countries could be exempted from the regime in future, referring to the idea of 'air bridges' - usually used to refer to military flights over enemy territory.

Countries with lower infection levels, such as Australia, New Zealand and Greece, could potentially be excluded from the tough rules, which will be enforced by law.

Earlier, Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary launched a savage attack on the government's plans for 14-day quarantine on arrivals to the UK.

The new rules are set dash hopes of summer holidays for most of the summer, as exemptions are largely limited to lorry drivers.

However, Mr O'Leary dismissed claims it will prevent his aim of resuming flights in July, saying he believes the policy is so 'defective' and impossible to enforce that the public will merely ignore it.

He insisted the government is 'making stuff up as they go along' and face masks are the best way to protect the travelling public - despite many scientists saying they are of limited benefit.

In the latest developments in the coronavirus crisis:

Britain's coronavirus death toll continued its downward trend today after officials announced 160 more victims, taking the official number of fatalities closer to the 35,000-mark;

Thousands more people have gone back to work as the transport network capacity is ramped up to help social distancing;

People should self-isolate if they lose their sense of taste or smell because it is a definite symptom of coronavirus, the government has announced today;

China is facing mounting pressure as the UK joins international demands for an independent inquiry into the handling of the disease at the World Health Organisation assembly;

Unions are facing calls to work with ministers to reopen schools amid warnings the poorest children are doing 75 minutes less home learning every day than their better-off counterparts;

Virgin Atlantic said that by introducing a mandatory 14 day self-isolation for every single traveller entering the UK, the Government is taking an approach that will likely prevent flights from resuming.

Loss of smell and taste is FINALLY classed as coronavirus symptom People should self-isolate if they lose their sense of taste or smell because it is a definite symptom of coronavirus, the government has announced today. Anosmia, the clinical name for a change in smell or taste sense, has become the third symptom of the coronavirus that will be officially recognised by the NHS. Until now, people were only advised that they might have the virus if they had a fever or a new continuous cough. But scientists working for the government have now decided there is enough evidence to add anosmia to the list. Prof Tim Spector, head of the department of genetic epidemiology and leader of the Covid symptom study app at King's College London, said 50,000 to 70,000 people in the UK with Covid-19 were currently not being told to self-isolate even though they had the virus. He blamed Public Health England (PHE) and the wider strategy, saying an insistence that only fever and cough were the major symptoms was missing thousands of cases. Until now, the NHS 111 coronavirus symptom checker has listed high temperature and cough as the symptoms of Covid-19. Prof Van-Tam said on April 3 that the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) had looked at the issue and concluded loss of smell or taste should not be added to the symptom list. But in the same month, ENT UK, the professional membership body representing ear, nose and throat surgery in the UK, published guidance to patients saying it believed loss of smell and loss of taste were symptoms of coronavirus and that it had shared these details with PHE. The World Health Organisation (WHO) listed loss of smell and taste as 'less common symptoms' several weeks ago and other countries, including the US, added the symptom. Advertisement

Mr Shapps has insisted quarantine measures from early June will be a 'blanket situation' for other countries initially but could be then eased for those with low Covid-19 infection rates.

Huw Merriman, Conservative chairman of the Transport Committee, asked in the Commons: 'If he will consider air bridges so that those entering the UK from countries where the infection rate is below the rate of one would not be subject to quarantine?

'This will boost confidence in aviation travel and target safety where it's most needed.'

Mr Shapps replied: 'Final details of the quarantine scheme will be released soon, come in early next month.

'It is the case we should consider further improvements - for example, things like air bridges enabling people from other countries who have themselves achieved lower levels of coronavirus infection to come to the country.

'So, those are active discussions but will go beyond what will initially be a blanket situation.'

It is understood that hauliers will make up two thirds of those not required to self-isolate for two weeks.

The rest are expected to include people who 'work supporting national security or critical infrastructure and to meet the UK's international obligations', officials said.

Scientists researching coronavirus may also be exempt. Last week Downing Street denied that travellers from France would be excluded, despite previously suggesting that was an option.

Ireland will not be covered by the rules due to the Common Travel Area's role in the Northern Ireland Peace Process.

But Mr O'Leary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the plans are 'unimplementable, unmanageable and unpoliceable'.

'People will simply ignore something that is so hopelessly defective... Let's have some effective measures like face masks,' he said.

'All you get back out of the UK government is ''we don't know''.'

'It's laughable that this government can come up with any plans for a quarantine that would be strict and fully enforced...

'It's idiotic and it's un-implementable. You don't have enough police in the UK.'

He added: 'Two-week lockdown has no medical or scientific basis to it in any event. If you want to do something that's effective, wear masks.'

Mr O'Leary said the policy had 'no credibility' and predicted that it would be axed by June.

What is an air bridge? An 'air bridge' is typically used by the military to reach and supply territory across enemy lines. One of the largest in history was used for the Berlin airlift after the Second World War. That kept the Western-held area supplied between June 1948 and May 1949 when it was cut off by Soviet forces. Another famous air bridge was 'The Hump', which was the route over the Himalayas from India to resupply Chinese forces working with the Allies.

He insisted research had suggested face masks could reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection by 98.5 per cent.

He told Sky News the government is 'making stuff up as they go along'.

'I think they are frankly just making stuff up as they go along,' he said. 'They are stumbling along grabbing whatever they think will make a headline.

There is no scientific or medical basis for a 14-day isolation for air passengers when you are not applying that equally to London Underground or London commuter train passengers.'

Virgin Atlantic appeared to back Mr O'Leary's comments and called for a 'multi-layered approach' of targeted measures to successfully restart flights.

The statement released today said: 'The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a devasting loss of life and livelihood for so many around the world and the UK.

'The safety and security of our people and our customers is our always our top priority and public health must come first. However, by introducing a mandatory 14 day self-isolation for every single traveller entering the UK, the Government is taking an approach that will likely prevent flights from resuming.

'We are continually reviewing our flying programme, however with these restrictions, there simply won't be sufficient demand to warrant flying and we are unlikely to resume passenger services before August at the earliest.

Oliver Dowden said quarantine rules for people travelling to the UK will be enforced by law

'We know that as the Covid-19 crisis subsides, air travel will be a vital enabler of the UK's economic recovery.

'Therefore, we are calling for a multi-layered approach of carefully targeted measures, which will allow for a successful restart of international air travel for passengers and businesses, while mitigating health risks.'

The Association of UK Airlines, the trade body for the industry added that if the government does push ahead with the 14-day quarantine plan then strict rolling reviews need to be in place.

Tell councils to reopen car parks and public toilets, says government expert Ministers must order councils to reopen public toilets and car parks and stop 'terrorising' those who want to visit beauty spots, a government adviser said today. Professor Robert Dingwall, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said the risk outdoors was 'minimal' and people did not need to be so anxious. The government eased draconian limits on exercise last week, with Boris Johnson saying the public is free to drive distances and enjoy public spaces as many times a day as they want. However, tourist boards have joined local authorities in saying visitors should stay away from beauty spots and seaside resorts. Weston-super-Mare has changed its slogan from 'Visit Weston' to 'Don't Visit Weston'

A spokesman said: 'Airlines are not going to operate if people are effectively told not to travel and that is going to do a lot of damage both to our tourism industry and businesses who rely on aviation for their supply chains and exports.

'If the Government does insist on doing this, with minimal exemptions in place, we need strict rolling reviews to be enforced so that this policy is not in place a second longer than it needs to be.'

Mr Dowden said quarantine rules for people travelling to the UK will be enforced by law.

He told Today: 'We would look at the relevant enforcement mechanisms just as we have done with other measures.

'So for example, the measures that we took when we introduced the so-called lockdown - those were underpinned by regulations which had consequences in law, and I'm sure we'll do the same thing.'

He said there would be 'very limited' exemptions to the rules.

John Holland-Kaye, the boss of Heathrow, raised hopes of looser rules yesterday, telling Sky News: 'If two countries are at very low risk of having transmission within each country, there should be a free flow of passengers.

'But if a country has very high risk with rising infection rates and poor controls, then there would be very tight controls on anyone accessing the UK from those markets.

Meanwhile, a government adviser has urged ministers to make councils reopen public toilets and car parks, and stop 'terrorising' those who want to visit beauty spots.

Tubes 'miss Sadiq Khan's 75% target and only hit 50%' as commuters wait up to 15 minutes for rush hour services after 30 drivers refuse to work

Sadiq Khan has claimed that Tube services would hit 75 per cent of pre-lockdown levels from today - but the true figure may have been closer to 50 per cent because of a lack of drivers, industry sources have told MailOnline.

Commuters also questioned the Mayor of London's figures as they still had to wait long periods for trains on packed platforms where social distancing was impossible during rush hour.

The Aslef union today revealed that more London Underground trains could have been running today but some drivers were sent home after they raised concerns about 'health and safety'. While the RMT Union also shared CCTV images of packed trains during rush hour this morning where most people were not wearing masks.

Tens of thousands more Britons are heading back into work today but gaps between trains in the capital were still up to 15 minutes with critics demanding to know why the Mayor of London is not running a full service now common in European capital cities such as Berlin.

Transport for London, which is run by Mayor Khan, said today that Tube services would be back at 75%, DLR and London Overground at 80% and buses at 85% of pre-lockdown capacity as Boris Johnson encouraged as many people as possible to return to work.

The majority of people who crammed on to this Tube train at Canning Town before 7am today were not wearing face masks as Britain returns to work

The RMT Union shared this image of a packed District Line train in rush hour today - where most were not wearing masks - as Aslef said some drivers were sent home for raising health and safety concerns

But as the morning peak ended a senior Tube source told MailOnline: 'That might be the aim but in reality, across the entire Tube network, it was about 50 per cent of service.' At least 30 Tube train drivers refused to work on Health and Safety grounds saying not enough had been done to protect both them and passengers from the virus, the insider said. MailOnline has asked Transport for London to comment.

ASLEF chief Finn Brennan also tweeted: 'Bizarre situation this morning where Underground managers are sending home drivers who raise H&S [health and safety] concerns..meaning fewer drivers available..so fewer trains!' He added: 'It's disappointing and worrying that so many people are still using the tube without face covering this morning. They are risking the safety of staff and other passengers'.

There was also confusion growing over whether commuters should wear masks and it was revealed that stations will be shut if they get too busy with security teams brought in to manage crowds.

Sadiq Khan has said that people catching the Tube or bus should cover their faces but in contrast Sir Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, said that face coverings are not mandatory on mainline trains with commuters claiming 'hardly anyone' is wearing them.

Sir Peter said: 'We are relying on people to be sensible. We want people to stay apart if they humanly can and if they can't, then a face covering is a quite sensible thing to do for the brief moments when you might be getting on or off a train or moving through a station'. He added: 'We have processes to close stations if they become too full'.

Roads also appeared busier today as Sadiq Khan brought back the congestion charge two weeks early - before the price rises from £11.50 to £15 next month and is imposed on weekends for the first time.",15,Low,Right

RSPB's dedicated Investigations Unit says it has been inundated with reports of predatory birds being illegally killed in recent weeks.

Targeted birds that have been killed in the last six weeks include hen harriers, peregrines, buzzards, red kites, goshawks and a barn owl.

Over the Easter Weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds after being hit 12 times by a shotgun. Several other of the birds were found dead in Wales, pictured, one of the unlawfully slaughtered animals

On 29 March, the same week Boris Johnson first urged people to stay at home due to COVID-19, a buzzard was found shot at Shipton, near York.

The animal suffered a fractured wing in two locations and shrapnel from the shot was seen throughout the bird's body on X-rays.

This animal was lucky and survived after being nursed back to health by a local wildlife expert before being released back into the wild.

Over the Easter Weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds after being hit 12 times by a shotgun.

The following weekend, wildlife presenter Iolo Williams recovered a dead red kite in Powys, which had been shot. Two other red kites were later found dead in the same area.

Scottish police were called out to investigate raptor persecution cases while there were multiple reports of illegal trapping on grouse moors.

All the act reported by the RSPB broke the law and breached the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

The intentional killing or injury of animals covered by the act is a criminal offence punishable by an unlimited fine or up to six months in jail.

Mark Thomas, RSPB Head of Investigations UK, said: Since lockdown began, the RSPB has been overrun with reports of birds of prey being targeted.

'It is clear that criminals on some sporting estates both in the uplands and lowlands, have used the wider closure of the countryside as an opportunity to ramp up their efforts to kill birds of prey.

'Spring is the time when birds of prey are most visible and therefore vulnerable, as they put on courtship displays, build nests and find food ready to breed.

Freak Mediterranean storm in April causes a drop in swift and swallow sightings A freak storm in the Mediterranean at the start of April may have led to a drop in the number of sightings of swallows, swifts and other migrating birds in the UK. Last month, thousands of birds migrating from Africa to Europe were blown off course due to high winds battering Greece, and were found dead in the streets. The British Trust for Ornithology, which tracks migrating birds as they arrive in the UK, say they've had reports from the across the UK of a decrease in numbers. They say that sightings of swallows, swifts and house martin numbers were all down and that the 'disastrous storm' in Greece is the most obvious cause. However, they warn that this is purely anecdotal evidence as they haven't been able to conduct proper surveys due to coronavirus lockdown measures. Advertisement

'It is clear the criminal actions are targeted and malicious in nature, taking out birds before they have the opportunity to breed, often in areas where they have previously faced persecution.

'We welcome the fact that the public is remaining vigilant and encourage any suspicious incidents to be reported. But please observe government guidelines at all times.'

The Moorland Association, which cares for 860,000 acres of heather moorland in England and Wales, claims birds of prey are benefiting from the lockdown.

Amanda Anderson, Director of the Moorland Association, said: 'Any confirmed reports of raptor persecution are cause for concern.

'The incidents specified near Leeds and York in the RSPB release are clearly not on grouse moors, while reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public.

'Estates across the country have reported a number of raptors including peregrine, merlin and hen harriers nesting and living on those landscapes.

'We condemn any illegal activity and Moorland Association members have signed up to a cross-sector zero tolerance approach to wildlife crime.

'Estates and gamekeepers have been the eyes and ears on the ground during lockdown, reporting suspicious activity.

'They are also actively working with police authorities in Operation Owl – an initiative to raise awareness of raptor persecution. We always encourage reporting of any suspicious incident.'

Superintendent Nick Lyall, head of the Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group, said: 'Over recent weeks, I have been sickened by the number of raptor persecution cases that have come to my attention as chair of the Raptor Persecution Delivery Group.

'I know that there are officers currently investigating a number of crimes against wild birds of prey which have occurred since lockdown began.

'It is clear that lockdown has been seen as a green light by those involved in raptor persecution offences to continue committing crimes, presumably in the belief that there are fewer people around to catch them doing so'",15,Low,Right

A pop-up eaterie has opened in a meadow in Sweden with just one table and one chair - and has welcomed its first guest.

The restaurant in Ransäter - named Bord for En, which is Table for One in English - has no waiters and the food is delivered to the table in a basket from the kitchen window via a pulley system.

The Swedish pop-up restaurant in a meadow that has just one table and one chair

Upon arrival, the guest is guided to the table by another rope that leads into the meadow.

'Once the rope ends, there's the chair and the table,' chef Rasmus Persson said, adding that the first basket to arrive at the table would carry a drink.

The table is located 50 yards away from the house Persson shares with his partner, Linda Karlsson, where the food is cooked, and they will only accept one guest per day.

The three-course menu will vary from day-to-day, but a sample menu on the restaurant's website reveals that dishes could include 'Swedish style hash brown, smetana, seaweed caviar and wood plucked sorrel', 'yellow carrot-ginger puree, browned hazelnut butter, sweet corn croquettes and serpent root ash' and 'ginned blueberries, iced buttermilk and viola sugar from our own beets'.

It will be up to guests to decide how much they pay for their three-course meal.

According to Travel and Leisure, once a customer leaves, the table will be left as it is for six hours before being sanitised.

Guests will be asked to leave their dishes in a container and they will be washed twice by the couple before they are used again.

Upon arrival, the guest is guided to the table by a rope that leads into the meadow

Persson said he and his partner had the idea for the restaurant when her parents came to visit in March and he prepared a table for them outside and served a meal through a window.

He added: 'I think one of the things many of us miss the most in these times is travelling.

'Since we can't geographically travel far I think at least by our minds we can travel and one of the best methods of having an inner travel, at least I think so, is by food and nature.'

Restaurants in Sweden have, unlike in many other countries, been allowed to stay open during the Covid-19 pandemic provided they observe social distancing guidelines.

The solo restaurant is fully booked through May, while some slots are still available in June and July, and they have weather protection for rainy days, Karlsson said.",15,Low,Right

Britain is home to works of art by some of the most important painters of all time, from J.M.W Turner to Salvador Dali.

These masterpieces hang in some equally magnificent buildings that are worth visiting alone for their architectural splendour.

Here we pick nine unmissable masterpieces and show you where to find them...

A haunting portrayal of a doomed monarch

Jewel in the crown: Windsor Castle, which houses some of the finest portraits from the Royal Collection

Experts say Van Dyck’s triple view of Charles I (above) captures the vanity and arrogance of the monarch who would lead the country into a long civil war

Charles I In Three Positions: The perfect place to view one of the world’s most famous Royal portraits is in the Queen’s Drawing Room at Windsor Castle. A rich selection of the finest portraits from the Royal Collection is dominated by this haunting portrayal of King Charles I by Anthony van Dyck (rct.uk).

Experts say Van Dyck’s triple view of Charles I captures the vanity and arrogance of the monarch who would lead the country into a long civil war – a conflict that would end in his own execution. This unusual composition was originally intended as a guide for a marble bust of the King by Italian sculptor Bernini – today it seems more reminiscent of a police mugshot.

The work was completed in 1635, seven years before the English Civil War started and 14 years before the King’s demise, but when Bernini viewed the painting his words were prophetic: ‘It is the portrait of a doomed man.’

Check in: The Miller of Mansfield, Goring, Reading. This award-winning restaurant with 13 rooms is a former coaching inn with creaky floors, low beams, open fires and luxurious handmade mattresses. B&B rooms cost from £109 a night (millerofmansfield.com).

Out of this world... Christ and a unique view of earth

The star attraction at Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Art Gallery is Salvador Dali’s ornate masterpiece depicting one of the most controversial Crucifix scenes ever painted

The painting is one of Scotland best-loved (and valuable) treasures. Glasgow Council recently rejected an £80 million offer from the Spanish government

Christ Of St John Of The Cross: The star attraction at Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Art Gallery is Salvador Dali’s ornate masterpiece depicting one of the most controversial Crucifix scenes ever painted (glasgowlife.org.uk/museums).

To create this epic work in 1951, which views Christ from above the Cross and looking down on Earth, the Spanish surrealist used a Hollywood stuntman as a model, whom he suspended for days.

Critics panned it but Glasgow Council boldly paid £8,200 for it in 1952. Locals protested and the painting was twice vandalised.

Now it is one of Scotland best-loved (and valuable) treasures. Glasgow Council recently rejected an £80 million offer from the Spanish government.

Check in: Sherbrooke Castle Hotel, Glasgow. Relax and recline amid tartan interiors, then dine on hearty Scottish classics. B&B rooms cost from £126 a night (sherbrookecastlehotel.com).

An epic memorial to the victims of war

Sandham Memorial Chapel, in Burghclere, was designed to house Sir Stanley Spencer’s magnificent series of 19 vast murals inspired by his First World War experiences as a medical orderly

From War To Resurrection: Discover Hampshire’s little-known version of the Sistine Chapel: a war memorial building designed to house Sir Stanley Spencer’s magnificent series of 19 vast murals inspired by his First World War experiences as a medical orderly.

Spencer devoted six years adorning the Sandham Memorial Chapel, in Burghclere, with his quirky, detailed scenes of everyday life to honour the forgotten dead. Now owned by the National Trust, the working chapel sits in gardens with views of the Hampshire Downs (nationaltrust.org.uk).

The value of Spencer’s work has soared since his death in 1959 – in 2011, a painting sold for £5.4 million, making the collection one of Britain’s most valuable art treasures.

The genius of William Frederick Yeames’s work – an imagined historic depiction of a Royalist boy being questioned by Parliamentarians during the Civil War – is that the outcome remains unknown.

Detailed composition and facial expressions are a nod to Yeames’s study of Renaissance masters such as Raphael while in Florence.

When the painting was unveiled in 1878, critical opinion was at odds with the public who adored it. The then newly opened Walker Art Gallery bought it for £750 (about £100,000 today) and it has remained a star attraction ever since (liverpoolmuseums.org.uk).

Check in: 30 James Street Hotel. The former HQ of the White Star shipping company, which owned the Titanic, is a stroll from the Walker Art Gallery. This luxury hotel offers the glittering decor of a first-class liner. B&B rooms cost from £96 a night (rmstitanichotel.co.uk).

The hell-raising poet as a quiet young man

Portrait Of Dylan Thomas by Augustus John is among Cardiff’s National Museum's internationally acclaimed art collection

Arguably the 20th Century’s most striking Welsh portrait, this image of poet Dylan Thomas links two iconic cultural figures

Portrait Of Dylan Thomas: Arguably the 20th Century’s most striking Welsh portrait, this image of poet Dylan Thomas links two iconic cultural figures. And it happened only because artist Augustus John persuaded his close friend to sit by handing him a bottle of beer.

The result is a timeless, endearing and deceptively simple portrait hinting at the relaxed relationship between the two Welshmen. And how fitting that it has stayed at Cardiff’s National Museum (museum.wales/cardiff).

Amid an internationally acclaimed art collection, John’s intimate portrayal stands out. The wide-eyed innocence of the boyish poet, with his neat blue scarf tied artfully, upturned jacket collar and tousled red curls, belies his later hell-raising reputation. Thomas was 23 and had just married John’s former mistress, Caitlin Macnamara, despite the two men coming to drunken blows over her.

John painted two portraits of Dylan Thomas in 1937-38 while at the peak of his success. This portrait was gifted to the museum, while the other was recently purchased by London’s National Portrait Gallery for £215,000.

The masterpiece with a murky past

Grand setting: Chatsworth House contains many of our most important pieces, including Thomas Gainsborough’s lavish portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire, Georgiana Cavendish

Georgiana, Duchess Of Devonshire: Chatsworth House in Derbyshire’s Peak District National Park is among Britain’s most glorious stately homes, but it’s worth a visit simply to view one of the world’s most famous paintings.

Thomas Gainsborough’s lavish portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire, Georgiana Cavendish, has repeatedly hit global headlines in a tangled history of being lost, sold, stolen, smuggled and hidden.

It helped that the subject, the flamboyant Duchess, was a celebrated society hostess, and Gainsborough, a leading artist of his day, painted her many times. In this version, her face is framed by an enormous black hat, which promptly set a trend for similar ‘Gainsborough’ hats.

The work mysteriously vanished in about 1800 but was discovered decades later above an elderly schoolmistress’s fireplace – she had trimmed it at the knees to fit. In 1876 it was sold at Christie’s for 10,000 guineas, a world record at the time.

Shortly afterwards, however, notorious American thief Adam Worth stole and hid it for 25 years. By 1901 it adorned the wall of Wall Street banker J. P. Morgan, and it wasn’t until 1994 that the Duke of Devonshire was able to buy it back for £320,000 and return it to its rightful home (chatsworth.org).

A thoroughbred at the home of horseracing

Fighting Stallions hangs among our best sporting art collections in Newmarket’s National Heritage Centre for Horseracing, a wide-ranging attraction in Suffolk opened by the Queen in 2016

Fighting Stallions: Where else might you expect to find a masterpiece by the finest-ever painter of horses, other than Newmarket, home of British racing? George Stubbs once spent 18 months dissecting horses to write an acclaimed scientific book on equine anatomy. He was then able to show off his incredible insight in Fighting Stallions, a work from 1791 inspired by a clash between two carriage horses.

Stubbs was largely ignored by the art establishment of his day, but his paintings can now command more than £20 million.

Mist and mystery from a genius at his peak

The Ulster Museum lies in Belfast’s Botanic Gardens, where art-lovers are drawn to a spectacular, almost impressionist work by J. M. W. Turner

Dawn Of Christianity (The Flight Into Egypt) by J. M. W. Turner

Dawn Of Christianity (The Flight Into Egypt): The Ulster Museum lies in Belfast’s Botanic Gardens, where art-lovers are drawn to this star attraction – a spectacular, almost impressionist work by J. M. W. Turner, one of Britain’s greatest artists.

Turner’s mysterious, misty image of half-submerged buildings and softly defined figures renders Dawn Of Christianity an extraordinary, historically significant painting. While contemporaries loyally painted romantic landscapes, Turner, even in his 60s, was showing himself to be at the peak of his creative prowess, experimenting with innovative techniques.

Even more unusually, he chose a round frame for the painting (which is still intact) as he believed it might ‘agree better with the field of vision’.

It ended up as the highlight of the Ulster collection thanks to a bequest from local shipping magnate Sir Donald Currie in 1913 (nmni.com).

Perfect depiction of an indomitable spirit

The Rain It Raineth Every Day by Norman Garstin is housed a few yards from the promenade that it depicts – in the charming Penlee House Gallery in Cornwall

The Rain It Raineth Every Day: The sentiment behind this image of west Cornwall’s coastline has made it one of our most popular artworks, and 130 years after it was painted, visitors still wander Penzance Promenade to find the exact location (and often the same weather).

Norman Garstin’s work makes it impossible not to sympathise with the woman struggling with a small child through wind, rain and sea spray. This tribute to the indomitable British spirit is now housed a few yards from the promenade that it depicts – in the charming Penlee House Gallery.

It’s a wonderful place to discover a treasure trove of works created by schools of artists based in Newlyn, St Ives and Lamorna, including Laura and Harold Knight, Stanhope and Elizabeth Forbes, and Lamorna Birch.

The one-eyed Irish teacher Garstin is less well known, but his masterful painting is certainly the most famous in the gallery (penleehouse.org.uk).

A third of Britons say they will travel 'more than ever' once coronavirus restrictions are lifted, a new survey has revealed

The survey, of 2,274 UK adults, was carried out by Skyscanner, which says that the results show that 'people will continue to travel as soon as restrictions allow, but that how they travel may change'.

For example, Skyscanner says that the survey highlighted that many will prioritise quality of the experience, with 64 per cent keen to make better use of their time for travel.

In addition, 54 per cent believe they’ll spend the same on travel and 12 per cent are planning to spend even more than usual.

‘Bucket-list’ travel is high on people’s agendas, with 75 per cent more likely to travel to their dream destination once restrictions are lifted.

Of those polled, 29 per cent said they wish to be more adventurous in the way that they travel, exploring new destinations and cultures.

Meanwhile, Skyscanner has also revealed the top five foreign destinations users have been searching for during April for travel from December 2020 to February 2021.

It explains that social distancing measures on aircraft would fundamentally shift the economics of aviation by slashing the maximum load factor to 62 per cent, well below the average industry ‘breakeven load factor’ of 77 per cent.

With fewer seats to sell, unit costs would rise sharply.

Social distancing on aircraft would lead to airfares rising to between 43 and 54 per cent, just for carriers to break even, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned

This IATA table shows how much carriers around the world would need to increase fares to break even

The IATA said it does not support social distancing measures that would leave ‘middle seats’ empty.

Instead, it supports ‘the wearing of face coverings for passengers and masks for crew while onboard aircraft as a critical part of a layered approach to biosecurity to be implemented temporarily when people return to travelling by air’.

In a statement, the IATA said additional measures could include temperature screening of passengers, airport workers and travellers; boarding and deplaning processes that reduce contact with other passengers or crew; limiting movement within the cabin during flight; more frequent and deeper cabin cleaning, and simplified catering procedures that lower crew movement and interaction with passengers.

It added: ‘When proven and available at scale, testing for Covid-19 or immunity passports could also be included as temporary biosecurity measures.’

The risk of virus transmission onboard aircraft is low even without special measures, the IATA explained.

It pointed to evidence such as contact tracing for a flight in January from China to Canada with a symptomatic Covid-19 passenger among the 350 in the cabin revealing no onboard transmission.

It added: ‘Contact tracing for a flight between China and the US with 12 symptomatic Covid-19 passengers [also] revealed no onboard transmission.

‘An IATA informal survey of 18 major airlines identified, during January-March 2020, just three episodes of suspected in-flight transmission of Covid-19, all from passengers to crew. A further four episodes were reports of apparent transmission from pilot to pilot, which could have been in-flight or before/after (including layover). There were no instances of suspected passenger-to-passenger transmission.’

The risk of virus transmission onboard aircraft is low even without special measures, the IATA explained

There are several plausible reasons why Covid-19, which is spread primarily by respiratory droplets, has not resulted in more onboard transmission, and is different from other modes of public transport, the IATA said.

One is that passengers face forward with limited face-to-face interactions and another is that seats provide a barrier to transmission forward to aft in the cabin.

The IATA also emphasised that air flow from ceiling to floor further reduces the potential for transmission, along with air flow rates, which ‘are high and not conducive to droplet spread in the same way as in other indoor environments’.

The risk of virus transmission onboard aircraft is low even without special measures, the IATA explained

The ‘High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA)’ filters on modern aircraft, meanwhile, ‘clean cabin air to operating theatre quality, further assisted by high levels of fresh air circulation’.

The cabin environment naturally makes transmission of viruses difficult for a variety of reasons Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO

Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO, said: ‘The safety of passengers and crew is paramount. The aviation industry is working with governments to re-start flying when this can be done safely. Evidence suggests that the risk of transmission onboard aircraft is low.

'And we will take measures - such as the wearing of face coverings by passengers and masks by crew - to add extra layers of protection. We must arrive at a solution that gives passengers the confidence to fly and keeps the cost of flying affordable. One without the other will have no lasting benefit.’

He added: ‘The cabin environment naturally makes transmission of viruses difficult for a variety of reasons. That helps explain why we have seen little evidence of onboard transmission.

'In the immediate term, our aim is to make the cabin environment even safer with effective measures so that passengers and crew can return to travel with confidence. Screening, face coverings and masks are among the many layers of measures that we are recommending. Leaving the middle seat empty, however, is not.’",15,Low,Right

Air France and KLM say they will be telling customers to wear a mask throughout their journey from next Monday (May 11).

German airline Lufthansa brought in the new rule yesterday (May 4), saying passengers must 'wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth'.

Air France is to make it compulsory for all passengers to wear a face mask from Monday, May 11

Air France says its face mask policy is in line with French guidelines that say face masks must be worn on public transport.

The airline says all customers will be notified of the new rule prior to departure and will be asked to 'ensure they possess one or more masks for their trip'. In addition, cabin crew and gate agents will also be required to masks.

Passengers travelling on the airline will also have to practice social distancing at the airport, while Plexiglass screens will also be installed where possible.

Onboard, passengers will be spread out as much as possible, with Air France saying the current low load factors 'make it possible to separate customers as required'.

Aircraft will also be cleaned daily with surfaces including armrests, tables and screens disinfected. Air France will also introduce a specific procedure for 'the periodic disinfecting of aircraft by spraying an approved virucidal product effective for 10 days'.

The in-flight service is limited with no meals and drinks offered on domestic and short-haul European flights.

On long-haul flights, cabin service is also limited and preference is given to individually wrapped products.

In addition, the airline says that the air in the cabin is renewed every three minutes as its aircraft are equipped with 'High Efficiency Particulate Air' - or HEPA - filters, identical to those used in hospital operating theatres.

Dutch carrier KLM says all passengers will be required to wear masks on its flights until August 31, 2020

The airline said: 'These filters extract more than 99.99 per cent of the smallest viruses, including those no larger than 0.01 micrometres, thus ensuring that cabin air complies with quality standards.

'Coronavirus type viruses, ranging in size from 0.08 to 0.16 micrometres, are filtered through the HEPA filters.'

Meanwhile, KLM has announced a new face mask policy and the gradual restoration of its European network.

The Dutch carrier says the mask rules are based on national and international guidelines and must be worn on board and during boarding.

Passengers are responsible for providing their own masks and the rule will stay in place until at least August 31, 2020.

The carrier added: 'Effective May 4, 2020, KLM will resume services – one daily flight, seven days a week – to the following destinations: Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Milan, Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and Helsinki.'

Lufthansa says passengers are being recommended to wear their masks throughout their entire journey, including in the airport, when 'minimum distance cannot be guaranteed without restriction'.

Lufthansa says: 'All Lufthansa Group aircraft are equipped with the highest quality air filters, which guarantee air quality similar to that in an operating theatre. In addition, the air circulates vertically instead of being distributed throughout the cabin'

Passengers must bring their own masks, but the airline also says that simple coverings such as scarves are also acceptable. The policy will be in place until at least August 31, 2020.

Lufthansa said: 'Despite numerous adjustments to service procedures, it is not always possible to maintain the required distance on a flight.

'Therefore, this measure serves as additional protection for all passengers. All flight attendants on Lufthansa Group flights in direct contact with customers will also be required to wear a mask.

'The current regulation of Lufthansa Group Airlines to keep the neighbouring seat free in economy and premium economy class will no longer apply, as wearing the mouth-nose cover provides adequate health protection. Due to the current low occupancy rate, seats will nevertheless be allocated as widely as possible throughout the cabin.

'In principle, infection on board remains very unlikely. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, no concrete cases of transmission on Lufthansa Group flights have become known.

'All Lufthansa Group aircraft are equipped with the highest quality air filters, which guarantee air quality similar to that in an operating theatre. In addition, the air circulates vertically instead of being distributed throughout the cabin.'

United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue and Frontier airlines have also made face masks compulsory for passengers.

Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific has not made face masks compulsory - although the carrier says they are available to passengers who want one.

Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has not made masks compulsory but is handing them out to passengers who want one

A source at Cathay Pacific told MailOnline Travel that the airline has been making health broadcasts at the boarding gate and recommending that passengers wear a mask.

However, the source explained that 90 per cent of Cathay Pacific passengers are already arriving at airports well prepared and only a small number of passengers need to request a face mask.

Nearly all Cathay passengers are wearing face masks in-flight, the source added.

On Qatar Airways, which is still operating between 30 and 50 flights a day, face masks aren't mandatory - unless they are required to be worn by the destination country.

A spokesman added: 'We are keeping it under review and following the scientific and health guidelines.'

Other airlines including British Airways and easyJet have not yet taken a position on masks.

A spokesman for British Airways said: 'Like all airlines – we adhere to industry and regulatory requirements and safety standards. We provide regular updates to our crew on best practise so they can take necessary precautions, and we have put additional measures in place to support our colleagues.

'These measures are constantly reviewed and enhanced wherever possible and we provide personal protective equipment to our crews on board. Onboard equipment meets UK regulatory standards.

Airlines including British Airways and easyJet have not yet taken a position on masks

'We have already made changes on board to reduce contact as much as possible, including temporary changes to our onboard catering, where customers will be offered pre-prepared refreshments, and removing the hot towel service.'

A Ryanair spokesperson said: 'The empty middle seat measure is wholly ineffective and does not comply with two-metre social distancing rules.

'We need effective health measures that work, such as wearing face masks and/or monitoring body temperature, which will help to meet health guidelines while allowing airline passengers to travel by coach and train to airports, to pass through crowded airports, and board/disembark aircraft without spreading Covid-19.'

An easyJet spokesperson said: 'EasyJet is already taking steps to see where we can enhance safety when we restart flights including additional aircraft cleaning and disinfection, procedures in the airport such as social distancing and providing personal protective equipment to our crew.

'This is being done based on discussions with international aviation agencies, supported by medical advice.

'We will ensure that we are in compliance with any new regulations set down by the relevant authorities ready for when flying resumes.'

Meanwhile, a Singapore Airlines spokesperson explained: 'No firm decisions have yet been taken as to additional safety measures that may be required once flying resumes in earnest.

'There are various options under consideration and details of Singapore Airlines’ plans will be announced in due course.'",15,Low,Right

Designs have emerged for two post-coronavirus economy cabin concepts aimed at helping to prevent future pandemics.

The 'Janus' takes its inspiration from the ancient two-faced Roman god and has a reversed centre seat, while the 'Glassafe' concept sees each seat fitted with a 'hood'.

The Janus concept would see the middle seat of a row placed in a reverse position, which Aviointeriors says will 'ensure maximum isolation between passengers'

The Janus takes its inspiration from the ancient two-faced Roman god

The designs are by Italian firm Aviointeriors, which has released renderings of both concepts.

Aviointeriors says the Janus seat will 'ensure the maximum isolation between passengers seated next to each other'.

While passengers seated on the side seats, aisle and fuselage, continue to face in the direction of travel, the passenger sitting in the centre is facing backwards.

Aviointeriors explained: 'Each passenger has their own space isolated from others, even from people who walk through the aisle.

'Each Janus seat is surrounded on three sides by a high shield that prevents the breath propagation to occupants of adjacent seats.

'It is made of easy cleaning and safe hygienic materials. The option is available with the shield in opaque material or with different degrees of transparency.'

Breathe easy: The Glassafe concept, which Aviointeriors describes as a 'kit-level solution'

Glassafe, meanwhile, is described as a 'kit-level solution' that can be installed on existing aircraft seats.

It would see screens installed around the top of the seats, which Aviointeriors says would make sitting in 'close proximity safer'.

It added: 'Glassafe is made of transparent material to make the entire cabin harmonious and aesthetically light, but perfectly fulfilling the objective of creating an isolated volume around the passenger.

'This is in order to avoid or minimize contacts and interactions via air between passenger and passenger, so as to reduce the probability of contamination by viruses or other.

A spokesperson for Aviointeriors says: 'All national authorities worldwide are trying to block this pandemic through a series of actions and recommendations and we want to contribute with our ideas and proposals in the interests of the whole community.

'With this objective in mind, we have studied new solutions that take into account social distancing among passengers sitting in economy class, where there is a condition of higher density, but with characteristics that remain applicable even in the lower density classes such as premium economy or business class.

This week, he looks at the prospects for package holidays this summer.

Question marks hang over millions of summer holidays this weekend as hotels, airlines and travel firms wait to discover when the world will reopen for business.

Until last week, Tui, the world’s largest tour operator, said it was hoping to start taking travellers to the sun again from May 14. Now it says beach holidays will be cancelled until at least June 11 and its ocean and river cruises won’t restart until June 30.

Leap of faith: Summer holidays may yet go ahead, but there are options if yours is not as originally booked

Jet2 has already cancelled holidays until at least June 17, and a new wave of cancellations from smaller package-holiday providers is expected to be announced in coming days.

Optimists in the travel industry say they hope that trips booked for the summer school holidays in late July and August will still take place as planned, though their best advice is to prepare for revised flight times or being switched to ‘similar standard’ accommodation if some hotels stay closed. This could even mean similar hotels in different countries altogether if, say, Greece recovers far faster than Spain, which has been one of the countries hit hardest by the crisis.

But it is equally important to have a strategy ready in case your holiday does get cancelled.

If it happens, the easy option is to rebook any time up to and including next summer. The big advantage in doing this is that if your original package holiday was ATOL-protected – part of the Government-backed scheme that looks after your money – then your next one will offer the same assurances.

Rebooking means you’ll also have a break in the sun to look forward to once the crisis ends.

If you can’t find a suitable alternative holiday straight away, your tour firm may offer you a voucher so you can book a similar-value trip within the next year. However, the risk with this is that if your tour operator goes bust, the voucher is likely to become worthless.

That’s why ABTA, the UK travel trade association, has created an alternative option called a Refund Credit Note (RCN). This has the flexibility of a voucher and its value can be used to book another trip as soon as you find one you like. Crucially, an RCN will be backed by the ABTA/ATOL safety nets so its value can be repaid if your tour firm goes under.

Until last week, Tui, the world’s largest tour operator, said it was hoping to start taking travellers to the sun again from May 14. Now it says beach holidays will be cancelled until at least June 11

It also has an ‘end date’ by when it can be exchanged for cash if you subsequently decide not to rebook at all.

Many of the first RCNs have July 31 as an end date, but firms can choose their own. Find out exactly what you should look for in a Refund Credit Note at abta.com under the heading ‘Coronavirus advice for customers’.

Finally, if your package holiday is cancelled and you simply want your money back, you are entitled to it. The rules say refunds should be paid within 14 days of cancellation, although many travel firms are struggling to find the resources to comply with that at the moment.

ABTA and consumer group Which? suggest a month is likely to be a more realistic timeframe, and advise making a note of when and how you request your refund so the company can’t try to avoid paying it later.

The Florida resort has been shut since mid-March as a result of the coronavirus crisis and there is no indication when it will welcome guests again.

But when it can admit visitors once more they will step into a world of magic, plus face masks, temperature checks, social distancing and hand sanitizer dispensing points at every ride.

Guidelines have been drawn up that offer a glimpse of what Walt Disney World might be like when it reopens

That's according to guidelines drawn up by the Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force, which has been charged with plotting the Florida area's route to normality.

The plan would include specific rules, which could be implemented at large-scale theme parks in the area, such as Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando.

In phase one of the reopening, parks would only be permitted to run at 50 per cent capacity and tape markings six feet apart would be required to show where guests would have to stand in lines, reports Disney news site WDW News Today.

All employees at the parks would have to wear face masks and undergo temperature checks with any staff recording a reading of 100.4F/38C or above sent home.

And staff with flu-like symptoms would be required to stay at home, as would any employees over the age of 65.

Touchless hand-sanitizer dispensers would be required at ticket gates, turnstiles and the entrance and exit of every attraction.

If all goes well and coronavirus cases in the area continue to decrease, phase two of the reopening will begin and parks will be allowed to run at 75 per cent capacity.

The task force has also laid out guidelines for the reopening of hotels and restaurants, which would also affect Walt Disney World.

Walt Disney World has been shut since mid-March as a result of the coronavirus crisis and there is no indication when it will welcome guests again

Measures would include limiting housekeeping services, room service only being delivered to hotel room doors, the use of mobile check-in where possible and no self-service food on offer.

In restaurants, menus would be disposable, hand sanitizer would be available on entry and takeaway orders would be encouraged.

All of the guidelines set out in the task force's report are open to being revised as the pandemic progresses.

The other closed Disney parks are the Disneyland Resort in California, Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland. Disneyland Shanghai in China partially reopened last month.

Last week, it was reported that Disney's theme parks might not open again until 2021.

This month, the Walt Disney Company announced it had ceased paying 100,000 staff to save $500million a month. The five-week shutdown has impacted more than 50 per cent of its workforce.",15,Low,Right

Bosses have installed ‘thermal fever detection’ cameras that are capable of recording body temperatures and alerting border guards to anyone with a fever.

The tripod-mounted cameras have been fixed to the airport’s staff entrance but will soon be installed at every entrance to the airport’s departures and arrivals terminals.

Bournemouth Airport will become the first UK airport to start checking passengers for signs of coronavirus. Pictured here is one of the ‘thermal fever detection’ cameras installed at the airport's staff entrance

The system will automatically alert border staff to any passenger showing signs of a high temperature, allowing them to intercept and isolate travellers before they board a plane.

It is hoped the technology will help airlines by removing the need to enforce social distancing – a move that industry leaders have warned could push up ticket prices 50 per cent.

The action by Bournemouth Airport – which is used by 800,000 passengers a year – marks a significant departure from the Government’s controversial decision to not screen travellers.

The system will automatically alert border staff to any passenger showing signs of a high temperature

It comes after the Daily Mail revealed that the boss of Heathrow had written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock calling for a set of stringent screening measures, which could include temperature checks, antibody tests and a requirement that all passengers carry health passports proving they are medically fit.

Ministers say around 15,000 passengers arrive into the UK every day. Incredibly, none are tested for signs of the virus but are simply handed information leaflets about symptoms.

Critics say the lack of tests threatens the health of the nation and makes a mockery of the lockdown conditions opposed on the rest of the country.

Heathrow executive John Holland-Kaye wants an internationally-agreed set of screening measures to restore confidence in air travel.

The airport’s executives also want Public Health England (PHE) to release evidence proving ministers’ claims that temperature screening is ineffective.

PHE has insisted that screening measures are futile against a virus that can have an incubation period of up to 14 days.

However, airport bosses are anxious that the total lack of tests makes the UK’s airports appear more dangerous than others around the world, where strict controls are in place to identify and isolate passengers displaying symptoms.

The Mail understands that at least two other airports are interested in installing the same ‘thermal fever detection’ cameras that are being used at Bournemouth.

Last week, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the screening policy around airports is ‘under review’ and may change in the future.

Gatwick Airport has also confirmed that it is working with the Department for Transport (DfT) on possible screening measures, which may include mass temperature checks.

A spokesman for SCC, the IT firm supplying the thermal cameras, said: ‘By deploying this technology as part of a range of measures, airports can begin to reopen for business safely, reducing the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 cases and protecting passengers and employees. Thermal fever detection could also help airlines by removing the requirement to undersell occupancy to enable social distancing on flights.’",15,Low,Right

The study, of all 217 destinations, was carried out by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), which said this represents the 'most severe restrictions on international travel in history'.

In addition, the research showed that 83 per cent of destinations have had coronavirus-related restrictions in place for four weeks or more, and so far none have been lifted.

Every destination in the world now has travel restrictions in place as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, new research has revealed

The UNWTO study broke down the type of restrictions that have been put in place across the globe and plotted the evolution of these since January 30, when the World Health Organisation declared Covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern.

The analysis shows that 45 per cent of destinations have totally or partially closed their borders to tourists.

Meanwhile, 30 per cent of destinations have totally or partially suspended international flights.

Eighteen per cent of destinations have banned entry for passengers from specific countries of origin or passengers who have transited through specific destinations.

And seven per cent of destinations have applied other measures such as quarantine or self-isolation for 14 days or different visa measures for new arrivals.

Now the UNWTO says it is leading calls for governments worldwide to commit to supporting tourism through this unprecedented challenge.

According to the organisation's Secretary-General, Zurab Pololikashvili, the sudden and unexpected fall in tourism demand caused by coronavirus places millions of jobs and livelihoods at risk while at the same time jeopardising the advances made in sustainable development and equality over recent years.

He explained: 'Tourism has shown its commitment to putting people first. Our sector can also lead the way in driving recovery.

'This research on global travel restrictions will help support the timely and responsible implementation of exit strategies, allowing destinations to ease or lift travel restrictions when it is safe to do so.

'This way, the social and economic benefits that tourism offers can return, providing a path to sustainable recovery for both individuals and whole countries.'

Out of 217 destinations, the UNWTO says that 45 per cent have totally or partially closed their borders to tourists

The research from the UNWTO comes as the London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) warns that the tourism sector faces a staggering 100million job losses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

WTTC says that the startling figure has increased by over 30 per cent in the past four weeks, indicating the sheer crisis affecting the sector.

It alerted G20 tourism ministers to the extent of the crisis at their latest gathering by virtual video conference. Of the 100.8million jobs at risk, almost 75million of them are in G20 countries.

Figures show the hardest-hit countries would be those in Asia followed by the Americas and then Europe.

Gloria Guevara, WTTC president and CEO, said: 'This is a staggering and deeply worrying change in such a short time.

'In just the past month alone, our research shows an increase of 25million in the number of job losses in travel and tourism. The whole cycle of tourism is being wiped out by the pandemic.

'We have alerted the G20 tourism ministers to the extent of the crisis and advised on how governments need to step in swiftly to support and protect our sector.

'Travel and tourism is the backbone of the global economy. Without it, global economies will struggle to recover in any meaningful way and hundreds of millions of people will suffer enormous financial and mental damage for years to come.'",15,Low,Right

The Chicago-based company said that the 'proactive and aggressive' measure is to keep all staff and customers safe.

The directive is in line with the most recent advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has recommended Americans cover their faces when in public.

United Airlines flight attendants must now wear face masks while flying

United said that masks have been added to all aircraft to ensure flight attendants have access to one mask each per day on duty.

The airline told cabin crew that these will be replenished as needed and when supplies permit and that they have worked hard to 'make sure we have enough supply to provide each of you'.

Alternatively, flight attendants are permitted to wear their own cloth face covering, so long as the fabric is in a solid, neutral colour.

United said that N95 masks (medical-grade masks) should only be worn by customers showing symptoms and 'for the flight attendants providing direct assistance', with the remaining supply of them left on board aircraft.

Flight attendants should wear masks at all times, said United, but it pointed out that they can be removed to perform certain duties, such as making an announcement.

They can also be removed in decompression situations when it is necessary to don an oxygen mask.

United said the 'proactive and aggressive' measure is to keep all staff and customers safe

Beginning in early May face masks will be made available to all the airline's customers as well.

A message from United Airlines to its cabin crew employees added: 'True to our mission of connecting people and uniting the world, you all continue to provide essential service and have been at the forefront of supporting communities by helping get people and goods where they need to be, often to the frontline of the Covid-19 crisis.

'At the same time, you continue to be diligent about the safety and social distancing measures we have put into place to mitigate against the spread of the virus and to ensure our people are safe and our aircraft are clean and sanitary.

'This new initiative is in line with the most recent CDC recommendation that says wearing a cloth face covering is advisable when in public and when social distancing is difficult to maintain.

'We understand that many aspects of the flight attendant’s duties, both on and off the aircraft, can make practising social distancing challenging, which is why this new initiative is so important.'

United's announcement comes as the airline industry takes a significant economic hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen travel demand shrink to essentially zero, airport traffic in the US plunge by 95 per cent and airlines lose billions of dollars.

Analysts anticipate airline earnings to decline by more than 200 per cent for the first quarter of 2019 - a stark contrast to the $1.8billion (£1.45billion) first-quarter profit a year ago.

The mobile 'Clean Trolley' contraption, which is has already been distributed in mainland Europe, can make 30 trolleys virus-free in less than under 30 seconds.

Trolleys are easily moved through the machine and is sprayed with virucide – a chemical agent that kills viruses, including the coronavirus.

Hundreds of the machines a week are being sold in already Germany, where they've been rolled out at supermarkets including Lidl and Aldi.

Video footage shows a long stack of supermarket trolleys being sterilised and delivered back to the trolley bay, safe to use for the next customer.

The contraption could be key to reducing the infection rates at busy supermarkets, which are being heavily relied upon during lockdown.

Inventors have come up with a machine they say could help Britain combat coronavirus - a 'car wash' for supermarket trolleys

Clean Trolley was invented in the Netherlands and is being distributed in Britain by Lancashire-based company Wilkinson Mobile Catering.

The company claims the machine is more thorough and efficient than the current method of a retail assistant wiping the trolley bar handle by hand.

The head of the company told MailOnline he believes the system supermarkets currently have deployed so far is 'woefully inadequate'.

'We have seen fears and potential huge spikes from a second wave of this virus, and things are very uncertain and unknown at the moment,' said Mike Wilkinson, managing director of Wilkinson Mobile Catering.

Clean Trolley contains virucide in a 10-litre container, which is mixed with water at a ratio of up to one to 400

'They are commonplace on the continent, especially in Germany where COVID-19 cases are a small fraction of what they are in the UK.

'It makes sense for supermarkets across our country to think ahead and start using such products right now.

'To ensure all surfaces are rendered virus-free instantaneously, we feel this is the best solution for supermarkets going forward.'

Clean Trolley can be stationed in the car parks of medium to large supermarkets and shopping complexes and operated by one employee.

The trolley is moved through the machine and is sprayed and cleaned with virucide - killing off the strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19, as well as other viruses

The supermarket staff member can stack up as many as 30 trolleys and push them through the device, which uses a food safe virucidal chemical mix.

The portable trolley wash requires a garden hose to emit the spray, as the chemical mix needs to become atomised with water to produce a fine mist.

Clean Trolley contains the virucide in a 10-litre container and is mixed with water at a ratio of up to one to 400, meaning it should easily last a full day's operation, and the viral mix can be reordered for £30.

Wilkinson said the Clean Trolley will take anything that is portable, but not electrical, including wheelchairs and hospital beds.

A garden hose is needed to combine water with the anti-viral chemicals and produce a fine mist

It could also be set up at airports to kill any remnants of the virus that are left behind on small and non-electrical ground support equipment or baggage trolleys, as an example.

Any object handled by a large amount of people in a short amount of time that could spread the coronavirus inadvertently could benefit from Clean Trolley.

The company said the vapour it uses has been approved by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, meaning it is safe to use.

Despite many enquiries from overseas – India in particular – UK health and safety regulations mean middle managers at supermarkets have been unable to authorise the company to demonstrate the trolley on a commercial basis in supermarkets.

Anything that is portable and handled by large groups of people that could spread the coronavirus would benefit from Clean Trolley

'At the moment we have hit a brick wall in the UK potentially due to the hierarchical management structure we have over here,' Wilkinson said.

'Given the importance now attached to clean shopping spaces, Clean Trolley would be a vital boost in the effort to promote public hygiene and limit the spread of COVID-19,' Wilkinson said.

Wilkinson Mobile Catering plans to donate 10 per cent of any profits to the charities fund for the NHS.

The company also manufactures portable hand wash stations, which are popular in supermarkets overseas, the company said.",15,Low,Right

Almost one in five people in London - 17 per cent - have already had the coronavirus, according to surveillance testing, meaning that around 1.53million people have been infected with the virus and recovered.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced testing for antibodies among a sample of the population has given the government the first indications of how many people have caught the disease already.

Meanwhile the rate across the rest of the UK appeared to be around five per cent, he said, which would equal 2.85million people.

This suggests that the death rate in London is considerably lower - around 0.62 per cent - than it is in the rest of the UK around it, where it appears to be closer to 1.39 per cent.

One expert suggested this could be because the average age of people in London is younger and COVID-19 is known to be more deadly for the elderly. And they claimed the price of land may mean there are fewer care homes, which have been ravaged by the coronavirus since the crisis began to spiral out of control in March.

The data is based on 1,000 tests done in late April and early May by Public Health England as part of its ongoing surveillance survey.

It comes after separate data from the Office for National Statistics today estimated that 0.25 per cent of the population is currently ill with COVID-19. It also showed that an estimated 61,000 people per week are still catching the coronavirus in England - an average of 8,700 each day.

This suggests one in 12 people who catch the virus end up in hospitals - 697 people were admitted to hospital yesterday (eight per cent of 8,700) and that number has remained relatively flat for the past week.

The announcement comes as promising figures showed two weeks have now passed since London diagnosed more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a day, while 2,615 more cases were announced across Britain today - taking the official number of patients infected past 250,000.

And Department of Health figures revealed a further 338 people have died, meaning the official death count is 36,042. But this data only takes into account patients who have tested positive - not the thousands of victims who weren't even swabbed.

Mr Hancock also announced in this afternoon's Downing Street briefing that NHS and social care staff would next week start to get antibody tests for coronavirus, to check whether they have already had the virus in the past and may have developed some form of immunity.

The Health Secretary announced the Government has bought 10million of Public Health England-approved tests from Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche and diagnostics giant Abbott, and would start by handing them out to NHS staff and carers.

Officials are also trialing a diagnostic swab test which can reportedly produce accurate results in 20 minutes, which they hope will speed up the process of diagnosing people - a process that can currently take days. The test, made by the company OptiGene, is being trialed in hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes in Hampshire.

More than five million people have been infected with coronavirus worldwide, with Latin America now seeing the largest rise in cases each day.

The number of new cases being diagnosed in all regions of England has been falling throughout May, with London now declaring fewer than 100 each day for a fortnight. The numbers for the most recent days will rise substantially in the coming days as more test results are confirmed

The total death toll for the UK yesterday (363) was the lowest mid-week number for almost two months, since March 25 - the week lockdown began. Experts say almost a third of hospitals have not reported COVID-19 deaths for two days or more

The estimates of past infection rates announced by Mr Hancock today suggest the death rate of COVID-19 is lower in London than in the rest of the country.

It can be reasonably assumed that at least 49,377 people have died across the UK so far - in their last publications, statistics bodies in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland published a death toll 37 per cent higher than the Department of Health had done on the same day - by 8 May, they recorded 42,862 compared to 31,241.

HOW DOES LONDON'S OBESITY RATE AND NUMBER OF OVER-65S COMPARE TO THE REST OF THE UK? LONDON Population: 8.98million Confirmed cases: 26,628 Estimated cases: 1.53million Percentage of population over 65: 12.3% Level of unemployment: 4.5% Percentage of people who are overweight: 58% Percentage of people who are white British: 44.9% UK AS A WHOLE Population: 66.65million Confirmed cases: 250,908 Estimated cases: 4.38million Percentage of population over 65: 18% Level of unemployment: 3.9% Percentage of people who are overweight: 63% Percentage of people who are white British: 81.9% Advertisement

Inflating today's death toll for the UK (36,042) lands at 49,377, and for London only - calculating the proportion of the total deaths made up by London at the last regional count (19 per cent) - takes the current death toll to approximately 9,579.

That many deaths among 17 per cent of London's population - 1.53million people - arrives at a death rate of 0.62 per cent.

Meanwhile, the number of deaths in five per cent of the population outside of London (39,798 among 2.85m people) leads to a death rate of around 1.39 per cent.

Mr Hancock's estimate suggests 2.85million people outside of London have had the virus, taking the national total to 4.38m.

Nationwide, the rate appears to be approximately 1.12 per cent.

Professor Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham, said: 'Without seeing the whole data it is not easy to be sure [why the death rate is lower in London].

'I would consider the average age of Londoners to be younger than outside.

'If people in London were seven years younger then there would be a 50 per cent lower death rate just from this measure alone.

'Also land is expensive in London so probably fewer care homes than outside per head of population.'

The suggested death rate is considerably higher than other countries' antibody surveys have suggested - in New York it was found to be around 0.79 per cent, while studies in Gangelt, Germany, suggested it could be 0.39 per cent and data from Helsinki, Finland pointed to just 0.19 per cent fatality.

All are much higher than flu, which kills around 0.1 per cent of all patients.

Hospitals in London announced just 13 fatalities yesterday.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4 this morning Professor Heneghan said at least six hospitals in the city have recorded no deaths in the past 48 hours.

He said: 'What [the numbers] have shown in the capital is highly reassuring - the numbers are coming down.

'At least six trusts are reporting no deaths in hospitals in the last 48 hours. Across the country it's about 30 per cent of all trusts have had no deaths in the last 48 hours...

'And, actually, if you look at information like 111 calls and 999 calls you're seeing a trend here that's showing - all of the data's showing - it's disappearing at a rate that's speeding up, which is highly reassuring.'

London, the UK's biggest city and home to some nine million people, has been the hardest-hit region by the coronavirus in raw numbers.

A total of 26,579 people have tested positive in the capital and 5,819 of them have died in hospitals.

It is being eclipsed, however, by the North West of England, which has a significantly higher rate of infection - 330.9 cases per 100,000 people, compared to 298.4 - and almost as many total cases at 24,132.

Matt Hancock's announcement today that 17 per cent of the population of London has been infected, compared to five per cent of the rest of the country, suggests that the death rate in London (0.62 per cent) is considerably lower (than 1.39 per cent) because the number of fatalities so far is a smaller proportion of the number of people thought to have been infected

A death rate of 1.04 per cent, as suggested by researchers at Stanford University in California based on a study of rates around the world, could mean 4.65million people in the UK have had the coronavirus already - significantly fewer than other death rate models from past studies have suggested. The 1.04 per cent is about in line with the 1.12 per cent suggested by British data

Professor Heneghan and colleague Dr Jason Oke have analysed statistics and found that six hospital trusts in London had reported no COVID-19 fatalities in the 48 hours up to today, Thursday May 21.

Those were Guy's and St Thomas', Homerton University Hospital, North Middlesex, Hillingdon Hospital, Homerton University Hospital, Whittington Health and University College London Hospital, The Telegraph reported.

And across England, 31 per cent of all major hospital trusts have not recorded deaths during the same period - 41 out of 131.

Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said he was feeling 'very cautious' about the news.

He told the Today programme: 'The virus is still out there. But what this good news - and it is good news - does give us is a window of opportunity to begin the test, trace, isolate and support programme which we so desperately need.

Britain has suffered the highest proportion of excess deaths in Europe during the coronavirus crisis. Excess deaths are those which happen above what would be expected over the same period in an average year

'We know that test, trace, isolate works best where numbers are low...

'My fear is that this good news could lead to complacency which could lead to a second wave that would overwhelm the NHS.'

VIRUS STILL INFECTING 61,000 PER WEEK IN ENGLAND The coronavirus is still infecting 61,000 people per week in England, testing data revealed today. The true figure could be as high as 111,000 people every seven days or as low as 29,000, the data shows. Around 0.25 per cent of the population is believed to be infected with the virus right now - around 137,500 people, with a possible range of 85,000 to 208,000 - and experts say the rate of infection is 'relatively stable'. This proportion has dropped by a tiny amount in the past week, from 0.27 per cent last Thursday, according to the Office for National Statistics. The government's statistics body calculated the data using test results from 14,599 people in 7,054 households across the country. Only 35 people tested positive for COVID-19 when they were swabbed between May 4 and May 17. Separate ONS data today revealed infection rates are not higher among health and care workers, despite results of a sample taken at an earlier date and published last week that showed they were six times more likely to be infected.

Separate data published today the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the coronavirus is still infecting 61,000 people per week, according to national surveillance testing.

The true figure could be as high as 111,000 people every seven days or as low as 29,000, the data shows.

Around 0.25 per cent of the population is believed to be infected with the virus right now - around 137,500 people, with a possible range of 85,000 to 208,000 - and experts say the rate of infection is 'relatively stable'.

This proportion has dropped by a tiny amount in the past week, from 0.27 per cent last Thursday, according to the ONS.

Professor Paul Hunter, a medicine expert at the University of East Anglia, said: 'One concerning factor is that the rate does not seem to have declined much since the previous report so does this mean that the decline in the epidemic is perhaps stalling as people start to get out more?

'Too early to say but we need to monitor this.

'Hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 are still declining, though maybe not as rapidly over the past few days.

'Deaths occur on average about 23 days after infection so the occupational risk will have dropped substantially in May when compared to April and there may not have been that many new infections in the period of today’s ONS study.

'So the bottom line is don’t draw too may conclusions from this.'

The government's statistics body calculated the proportion of the population infected using test results from 14,599 people in 7,054 households across the country. Only 35 people tested positive for COVID-19 when they were swabbed between May 4 and May 17.

The 35 people who tested positive for current infection came from 32 different households, suggesting that many of them either lived alone or had managed to not infect the people they live with.

The ONS report, which is released weekly, said: 'When comparing... the results in this publication against the results published in the previous publication, it should be noted that the change is relatively small and it should be interpreted that the number of people in England that have COVID-19 is relatively stable.'

Britain's lockdown was relaxed towards the end of the testing period this data covers. More people are likely to have given swab samples in the first 10 days of the still locked down period (May 4 and May 13) than in the four days after lockdown relaxed.

Therefore it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the effect new rules have had so far on the rate of infection.

BRITAIN'S DAILY DEATH TOLL DROPS AGAIN AS OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE 338 MORE VICTIMS Britain's daily coronavirus death toll dropped again today as health chiefs announced 338 more victims, meaning the official number of victims has now surpassed 36,000. The Department of Health toll - which takes into account deaths in all settings - is the lowest figure recorded on a Thursday since March 26 (103) and is even lower than yesterday's count of 363. NHS England confirmed one of the victims was a 14-year-old who had an underlying health condition - but officials did not reveal what medical issue the teenager had. Government data released today also showed another 2,615 people have tested positive for COVID-19, taking the official size of Britain's outbreak past a quarter of a million (250,908). And more than two million people have now been tested for the virus (2,064,329), with 67,681 people tested in the last 24 hours.

People are now allowed to spend unlimited amounts of time outside, as long as they stay 2m (6'6"") away from others, and more people are returning to work.

If the number of people infected, and the speed at which the virus is spreading, continue to come down, the government will consider starting to reopen schools and high street shops in June.

ONS data also did not show that rates among healthcare workers were higher for people who were tested at home in its sample, which it did find when the first round of results were published last week.

This week's data showed that 0.24 per cent of working adults were infected, regardless of whether they worked in patient-facing healthcare. Fewer than half as many medical workers tested positive compared to last week.

Last week, 1.33 per cent of patient-facing employees tested positive, compared to 0.22 per cent of people with other jobs. However, because the numbers are so small this is easily skewed.

This week's data showed no increased likelihood of infection based on age or sex.

Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said: 'The ONS survey results are very welcome, but their finding that infection rates do not vary between age groups should be interpreted with caution.

'While they are technically correct that there is no statistically significant differences, the results for younger people are only based on a handful of positive cases: the wide confidence intervals suggest there were perhaps three who tested positive out of around 1,150 2-11 year-olds tested, and only one positive case out of around 1,700 12-19 year-olds tested.'

Thousands of Britons flocked to beaches today to bask in 80F (26C) temperatures today as police warned lockdown-breaking campers to keep away after many ignored no staying overnight rules amid fears of a second spike of coronavirus deaths.

LONDON HAS RECORDED FEWER THAN 100 CASES A DAY FOR A FORTNIGHT Two weeks have now passed since London diagnosed more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a day, statistics show. Fewer than 100 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus each day in the capital for almost a fortnight since May 7, when there were 149 new cases. This marks a staggering drop from the more than 1,000 cases being diagnosed each day at the outbreak's peak. By comparison on May 15 - the latest date for which data are reliable, 52 people were found to have the disease, despite a marked increase in testing capacity over the past month. And Professor Carl Heneghan, a University of Oxford epidemiologist who has been tracking the outbreak data closely, said 30 per cent of NHS hospitals haven't recorded a single COVID-19 fatality in the past two days. He said all signs point to the coronavirus 'disappearing at a rate that's speeding up, which is highly reassuring'.

Devon and Cornwall's police and crime commissioner Alison Hernandez warned people to 'think twice' before they 'break the rules by staying overnight, parking illegally or driving dangerously'.

It came after her officers sent illegal campers home from Newquay and six people were killed or badly injured on the roads over the past five days.

Meanwhile, in the coastal town of Woolacombe in Devon, traffic wardens issued more than 70 tickets as all car parks were shut to keep away visitors.

Local councillor Andrea Davis warned people to stay away: 'Please note the car parks in Woolacombe are NOT open, the loos not open, the cafes not open,' she said. 'Please consider all these facts before visiting. Yesterday there was chaos..'

Her concerns were echoed by Steve Double, the Tory MP for St Austell and Newquay, who said that day-trippers from outside of Cornwall should not be coming to the county.

Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Double said: 'We are concerned about the next week as people come to places like Cornwall and abuse the new rules by sleeping over.

'The restrictions are clear that while people free to travel for day trips they are not permitted to sleep in camper vans or in tents overnight.

'We want to be able to welcome people a bit later in the year but we can only do that if we get on top of this virus. Do not come to Cornwall at this time.'

Young people in particular have admitted to getting tired of lockdown and a poll of 90,000 Britons found fewer than half of 19 to 30-year-olds are 'strictly' abiding by Britain's lockdown rules.

CORONAVIRUS IS STILL INFECTING 61,000 PEOPLE EVERY WEEK IN ENGLAND, DATA SHOWS The coronavirus is still infecting 61,000 people per week in England, testing data revealed today. The true figure could be as high as 111,000 people every seven days or as low as 29,000, the data shows. Around 0.25 per cent of the population is believed to be infected with the virus right now - around 137,500 people, with a possible range of 85,000 to 208,000 - and experts say the rate of infection is 'relatively stable'. This proportion has dropped by a tiny amount in the past week, from 0.27 per cent last Thursday, according to the Office for National Statistics. The government's statistics body calculated the data using test results from 14,599 people in 7,054 households across the country. Only 35 people tested positive for COVID-19 when they were swabbed between May 4 and May 17. Separate ONS data today revealed infection rates are not higher among health and care workers, despite results of a sample taken at an earlier date and published last week that showed they were six times more likely to be infected. The results come as leaked results from an antibody survey - blood tests designed to reveal who has recovered from the illness - suggest that young people are getting infected more often, even though their levels of severe illness are extremely low. Data seen by the Health Service Journal suggests that in London, which was at the heart of Britain's outbreak, people aged between 17 and 29 were most likely to have been infected. This is shown not in hospital data but in surveys of who has antibodies - substances in the immune system - to show that they have fought off the disease already.

The poll s found people are still sticking to the bulk of the rules but are starting to ignore things like keeping two metres apart.

Among all adults, complete compliance has fallen from 70 per cent to under 60 per cent in the last fortnight.

While among young adults it has dropped from a high of 60 per cent in mid-April to around 45 per cent by May 17.

University College London scientists, behind the survey, also said there had been a drop off in confidence in the Government since it switched its stance from 'stay at home' to the more ambiguous 'stay alert' on May 10.

Lead author Dr Daisy Fancourt, of UCL's epidemiology and health care unit, said: 'Confidence in Government has fallen in England since the easing of lockdown was announced, and is lowest in those under the age of 30.'

The ongoing study - launched in the week before the UK shut down on March 24 - quizzed adults about how they are feeling on a range of issues during the pandemic.

These include the lockdown, Government advice, their overall wellbeing and mental health.

It also found that 95 per cent of all adults felt they are either 'reasonable' or 'good' at sticking to the measures.

Those questioned were asked to rate the Government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic from one to a top mark of seven.

Their view of the Government's performance had dropped from five at the beginning of lockdown to around four, according to those who were questioned between May 11-17.

Levels of anxiety and depression had not improved since the easing of lockdown, while worries about possibly getting ill from Covid-19 had fallen slightly.

Fears about food, finance and unemployment were a cause of stress for some people.

The researchers found that around one in 12 people said they were worried about unemployment, while around one in eight people were worried about finances.

Stress about being able to get enough food had stabilised in the past week, with fewer than one in 20 people saying they were worried about this.",15,Low,Right

Before the United Kingdom went into lockdown, alcohol sales shot up by around 67 per cent, with many subsequently drinking at home in isolation.

Britain is facing a surge in alcohol-related health problems following COVID-19 due to an increase in alcohol abuse during lockdown, medical experts have warned

The warning was written in an editorial in the The BMJ penned by Baroness Ilora Finlay, chairwoman of the Commission on Alcohol Harms, and Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance.

'Now, as signs emerge of some control over new cases of COVID-19, it is increasingly clear that if we don't prepare for emerging from the pandemic, we will see the toll of increased alcohol harm for a generation,' they wrote.

They added that the pandemic 'has the potential to be an exemplar of our ambivalent relationship with alcohol and its consequences.'

People with pre-existing problems with alcohol and those on the 'brink' of dependence are at particular risk, they warned.

For these vulnerable people, they added, 'dependence will be triggered by bereavement, job insecurity or troubled relationships.'

'Before COVID-19, only one in five harmful and dependent drinkers got the help they need; the proportion will be even lower now.'

The number of people with alcoholic liver disease was increasing before the crisis, and will rise further as a result, the experts predicted.

Alcohol treatment services will also see a surge in demand, they said.

Before the United Kingdom went into lockdown, alcohol sales shot up by around 67 per cent, with many subsequently drinking at home in isolation

The duo also raised concerns around how alcohol consumption is linked to domestic violence, highlighting the increase in the number of calls to domestic violence charities at the start of lockdown.

'Tackling alcohol harms is an integral part of the nation's recovery,' they concluded.

The API — a software blueprint — will be used by a nation's health authority to build their own apps and has so far been given to 22 countries who requested access to the technology.

Apple and Google did not reveal which countries are set to use the software but it is believed the API will be adopted by several US states, Latvia, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands.

The system is a rival approach to the NHS contact-tracing app currently being tested in the UK.

The Apple and Google software follows a 'decentralised' approach - where the contact data collected stays on a user's device and can be analysed there.

Security experts say this method increases privacy and reduces the risk of identifying users by de-anonymising data.

Health experts will use the core software developed by the tech giants, add their own refinements and create their own unique app.

Although different countries will create an app based on the software, Apple and Google executives today promised there will be no issues connecting to another country's app which uses the same API.

However, there will likely be difficulties in getting the Apple-Google model to interact flawlessly with contact-tracing apps developed separately, such as the NHS contact tracing app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight.

Governments that use the Apple-Google API for their COVID-19 contact-tracing app are prohibited from using the data for targeted advertising or accessing location services.

Users that opt to download an app based on the Apple/Google blueprint will have to give explicit permission allowing the Bluetooth-based system to work and also have to give the rubber stamp for the app to share a positive test result with the relevant public health authority.

Apple and Google representatives said on a conference call today that the API will allow for seamless interactions between iOS and Android handsets.

They also claim the app will have only a trivial impact on device battery life and the US-based tech giants say they have the ability to disable the software on a region-by-region basis after the pandemic.

Apple and Google have today announced the launch of their coronavirus contact-tracing app software. The API — a software blueprint — will be used by a nation's health authority to build their own apps and has so far been given to 22 countries

What counties are using the Google-Apple API? Their API - a software blueprint for individual apps built by each country's health authority - will be available in 22 countries around the world. Apple and Google did not reveal which countries are set to use the API but it is believed the API will be adopted by several US states, Latvia, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. The UK is not using the system and has instead built its own app via NHSX- the digital arm of its health service. It leaves the UK at odds with Switzerland, Austria, a pan-European group called DP3T and the tech-savvy Estonians who are all backing a decentralised app, as advocated by Google and Apple. In Europe, only France, and now Britain, have come out as supporters of a centralised system. Australia, it is believed, is also running a centralised app. Early reports from the NHSX trial of the app reveal it is battery intensive and temperamental. Paola Pisano, Minister for innovation, technology and digitisation of the Italian government, said: 'The contact tracing application takes advantage of the operating systems of Apple and Google; such a choice increases its efficiency while preserving users' privacy. 'The solution enhances the interoperability potential with other apps that bordering countries may adopt. 'Also, it facilitates the sharing of foreign citizens' codes that are transmitted through privacy preserving techniques.' Advertisement

The release of the API comes amid widespread debate on whether or not countries should use the Apple-Google system or create their own.

Sang-Il Kim, director for digital transformation at the federal office of public health in Switzerland said his country will be using the API built by the world's foremost smartphone experts.

'We welcome the general availability of the Exposure Notification API, which provides the base for the SwissCovid app,' he said in a statement.

'As soon as the final measurements currently under way at EPFL and ETH Zurich complete, we will start the pilot of the app, in line with the Ordinance of the Federal Council of 5/13/2020.'

Ms Ieva Ilves, adviser to the Latvian President for Information and Digital Policy, called using the Apple and Google app 'the right thing to do'.

'To save lives, we need to strike the right balance between trust, ease of use, value and user privacy,' she said.

'Through our close work together with Apple and Google, we have a good start to launch the app in Latvia.'

Apple and Google have devised a decentralised method. No movement or tracking information will be stored on a central server, meaning it is invisible to Google, Apple and the relevant health authorities.

In a centralised system, such as is being used in the UK, when a user develops symptoms and chooses to declare it, they consent to sending their data to a central server.

This server is controlled by the health authorities, in the UK that is the NHS, and the data is analysed there.

The British Government has argued this approach allows for deeper analysis of the spread of COVID-19, enabling the health service to gain a better understanding of the virus while critics say it sacrifices user privacy.

Apple and Google's decentralised approach works by exchanging a digital 'token' with every phone a person come within Bluetooth range of.

Each device will randomly create a unique identifying 'key' which will change regularly.

This will be processed by a smartphone and then,if a person inputs that they are COVID-19 positive, the handset pings out a notification to all people who may have been infected by this person.

This is all done without any information being sent back to a server operated by either Google, Apple or a nations's the health authority.

Health authorities will be able to customise their app based on the API provided, for free, by Google and Apple.

They will be able to decide what sort of distance and time is considered to be an infection event as well as being able to decide how many people a single person may have infected, based on their own calculations and science.

Public heath bodies will be able to contact a user using information supplied by the person who downloaded the app and entered it voluntarily.

Health organisations developing the app will also be able to implement their own next steps via the app, such as recommending self-isolation.

Apple and Google first announced they were working on the API on April 10 and has since been in contact with healthcare authorities, healthcare professionals and privacy experts.

The API has today been made available to government health authorities around the world and 22 countries have so far requested access to the software, which has been granted by the tech firms.

This app-based system will be deployed in conjunction with traditional contract tracing methods and is not intended to be a silver bullet, Apple and Google representatives said

There will likely be difficulties in getting the Apple-Google model to interact flawlessly with contact-tracing apps developed separately, such as the NHS contact tracing app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight (pictured)

Apple and Google said in a statement: 'One of the most effective techniques that public health officials have used during outbreaks is called contact tracing.

'Through this approach, public health officials contact, test, treat and advise people who may have been exposed to an affected person.

'One new element of contact tracing is Exposure Notifications: using privacy-preserving digital technology to tell someone they may have been exposed to the virus.

'Exposure Notification has the specific goal of rapid notification, which is especially important to slowing the spread of the disease with a virus that can be spread asymptomatically.

'To help, Apple and Google cooperated to build Exposure Notifications technology that will enable apps created by public health agencies to work more accurately, reliably and effectively across both Android phones and iPhones.

'Over the last several weeks, our two companies have worked together, reaching out to public health officials scientists, privacy groups and government leaders all over the world to get their input and guidance.

'Starting today, our Exposure Notifications technology is available to public health agencies on both iOS and Android.

'What we've built is not an app — rather public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install.

'Our technology is designed to make these apps work better. Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to Exposure Notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app.

'User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.

'Today, this technology is in the hands of public health agencies across the world who will take the lead and we will continue to support their efforts.'

To ensure maximum uptake of the apps which utilise the API, Apple and Google is restricting each nation to just one app each.

This app-based system will be deployed in conjunction with traditional contract tracing methods and is not intended to be a silver bullet, Apple and Google representatives said.

It will use Bluetooth to send out non-contact, low-energy signals and detect other phones with the app nearby. The API will be able to gauge how far away people are based on Bluetooth alone and the app will not use location services or GPS.

Google and Apple decided to get involved with the fight against COVID-19 and develop their own API in an unprecedented partnership between the two smartphone rivals.

They were aware that neither iOS or Android would work efficiently as part of a Bluetooth-orientated form of contact tracing due to their inherent security and privacy measures.

Apple and Google representatives said they were also aware that independent apps would have difficulties due to this and the fact Apple phones will struggle to detect Android handsets, and vice versa.

Specific issues singled out by the company representatives include:apps being unstable, draining of battery life, incompatibility with apps made by different countries using a separate API, and a limited uptake of the app.

Experts say 60 per cent of users need to download the app for it to be effective and Apple and Google hope that by using their system, this is more likely than if nations go it alone.

Germany initially decided to create its own app and use a centralised approach, but has now made a U-turn and is believed to be planning on using the Apple/Google model.

The UK's contact-tracing app however is built by the NHS and will not use the Apple-Google API.

It leaves the UK at odds with Switzerland, Austria, a pan-European group called DP3T and the tech-savvy Estonians who are all backing a decentralised app, as advocated by Google and Apple.

In Europe, only France, and now Britain, have come out as supporters of a centralised system. Australia, it is believed, is also running a centralised app.

Earlier this week, Michael Gove revealed more than 21,000 coronavirus contact tracers have now been recruited in the UK.

Professor Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor in the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University of Nottingham, said: 'We need to contact trace everyone who tests positive. With 21,000 contact tracers each working two days a week you will have 6,000 contact tracers working per day.

'Assuming they work 8 hours a day and they each are able to contact trace an average of 4 new cases a day then it would be easy to trace 24,000 new cases per day.

'The app's importance is identifying possible contacts you don't know the name of or contact details for e.g. that person you followed round when shopping.'",15,Low,Right

A study of eight children admitted to a Birmingham hospital with the condition reveals they were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus several weeks before showing symptoms.

All of the children tested negative in the traditional lab-based test used to diagnose COVID-19 in adults.

However, a custom-built antibody test revealed the young patients had been infected with the coronavirus and produced antibodies to fight off the pathogen.

Doctors who treated the children say antibody tests are the only way to accurately identify the presence of the virus in children suffering with the hyperinflammatory condition, which can be fatal.

It remains unknown why the syndrome develops weeks after infection, but scientists believe it may be due to a severe overreaction from the body's own immune system.

This 'immune-mediated pathology' causes the immune system to go haywire and can cause damage to the body's own cells.

A similar phenomenon has been seen in adults, and it can be fatal to the sickest patients.

The syndrome affecting children has been tentatively called PIMS-TS, for 'paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2'.

However, the British scientists say the condition's definition is incorrect as it is not 'temporally associated' with the pandemic but is instead 'triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection'.

Bertie Brown was admitted to Worcestershire Royal hospital last month on his second birthday after developing a fever and rash across his body

The Kawasaki-like condition is a form of toxic shock syndrome which causes the body's immune system to attack its own organs

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE SYNDROME? WHAT SYMPTOMS DOES IT CAUSE? The majority of the children being hospitalised with the condition have suffered from a high fever for a number of days, severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Some develop a rash and red eyes or red lips, while a very small group go into shock, in which the heart is affected and they may get cold hands and feet and have rapid breathing. The symptoms are similar to those caused by Kawasaki disease, a rare but treatable condition that affects around eight in every 100,000 children each year in the UK. WHEN DID OFFICIALS FIRST START TO SEE CASES? The NHS sent an alert to doctors on April 27, warning them to look out for signs of the syndrome. At the time they said cases had been appearing in tiny numbers in London for about three weeks. Since then they have spread further across the country and between 75 and 100 children are known to have been infected. IS IT CAUSED BY SARS-COV-2, THE CORONAVIRUS? Doctors are almost certain the illness is being caused by the coronavirus but they haven't yet been able to prove it. Cases began appearing as the UK's coronavirus outbreak hit its peak and similar conditions have been reported in China and Italy during the pandemic. However, not all children with the Kawasaki-like syndrome test positive for the virus. Swab testing has suggested some of the children have not been infected with COVID-19 at the time they were ill. But all patients have tested positive for antibodies, doctors said, meaning they have had the coronavirus in the past. They said this suggests it is a 'post-infectious phenomenon' which is caused by a delayed overreaction of the immune system, which may happen weeks or even up to a month after the child was infected with COVID-19. IS IT TREATABLE? Yes. All but one of the children who have been diagnosed with the syndrome have survived. The only child known to have died with it, a 14-year-old boy, died of a stroke that was triggered by the life support machine he was on. Doctors are currently treating the condition by using medications to calm down the immune system and dampen the overreaction. Dr Liz Whittaker, a paediatrician at Imperial College Healthcare in London, said the sickest children are usually very ill for four to five days and begin to recover a couple of days after starting treatment.

A team of scientists led by Dr Alex Richter and Professor Adam Cunningham of the University of Birmingham studied eight young patients who were admitted to hospital between April 28 and May 8.

Lab tests — which are used to identify COVID-19 and also to screen healthcare workers — came back negative for all eight individuals.

These tests, called PCR tests, are extremely reliable and are 'the nearest to a gold standard for determining active infection'.

Professor Adam Cunningham, who led on the research alongside Dr Alex Richter and Dr Barney Scholefield, told MailOnline: 'The PCR picks up the presence of the virus itself, so the virus needs to be present at the site in the throat where the sample (usually a throat swab is taken).

'If you clear the infection then there will not be virus there to detect.

'In response to infections, we often make antibodies, and these are usually detectable from 14 days after the first time you are infected.

'These antibody responses often persist in the body for months and often many years afterwards.'

The average age of the children admitted to hospital was nine years old and five of the patients were boys.

Seven of the patients showed symptoms of both hyperinflammation and Kawasaki disease.

One of the patients was expressing symptoms of hyperinflammation as well as some signs of toxic shock syndrome.

The mysterious and dangerous condition is being described by top medical professionals as very rare and symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, rashes and red lips and eyes.

A very small group go into shock, in which the heart is affected, and they may get cold hands and feet and have rapid breathing.

Of the eight children treated in Birmingham and studied as part of this landmark research, all patients had fever and at least one gastrointestinal symptom such as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea.

Six of the patients required admission into paediatric intensive care due to heart-related issues and low blood pressure brought on by the disease.

All showed positive signs after treatment and have since been discharged from ICU.

Due to the reports in the media and claims from leading advisers and prominent politicians that this condition may be linked to the coronavirus pandemic, the researchers took blood samples for analysis from all eight children.

They then developed an custom antibody test with the help of researchers at the University of Southampton.

The test involves making an artificial copy of a key protein on the surface of the coronavirus which looks like a spike.

This unique 'spike' is a key identifier of the killer virus and was first revealed in detail by Professor Max Crispin of the University of Southampton.

He modelled the protein's surface spikes and this has allowed his team to produce an almost exact copy of the spike.

In the Birmingham hospital, this artificially created version of the protein spike was mixed with blood samples from the patients.

The researchers saw that some antibodies in the blood of the children bound to the spike, in the same way they would if the virus itself was invading.

In the tests, researchers looked to see which of three different immunoglobulins (the technical name for an antibody) - IgG, IgA and IgM - locked onto the imitation virus.

A positive IgM reading in the tests indicates a recent infection whereas a positive reading for IgG and IgA shows an older infection, the scientists say.

The children in the Birmingham hospital had no IgM antibodies but did have IgG and IgA antibodies, showing that they were infected with SARS-CoV-2 several weeks previously.

This time delay is the reason the PCR test did not detect the infection, the researchers say.

Italian hospital sees 30-FOLD increase in children admitted for rare inflammatory condition New analysis suggests the rare inflammatory condition increasingly being seen in young children is in fact linked to the novel coronavirus. Researchers in Lombardy, Italy - the epicenter of the country's outbreak - looked at 10 pediatric cases with symptoms such as a full body rash and swollen hands and feet. By comparison, over the last five years, just 19 children were admitted to the ER with the symptoms which resembled Kawasaki Disease. The team says the admissions for these symptoms over the last two months is a 30-fold increase from what it normally sees. 80 percent of the children admitted to the hospital this year tested positive for coronavirus antibodies and 60 percent had more severe complications such as heart issues. 'We noticed an increase in the number of children being referred to our hospital with an inflammatory condition similar to Kawasaki Disease around the time the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was taking hold in our region,' said co-author Dr Lucio Verdoni, a pediatric rheumatologist at Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, Italy. 'Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children. 'Parents should follow local medical advice and seek medical attention immediately if their child is unwell. Most children will make a complete recovery if they receive appropriate hospital care.'

'IgM was not detected in children, which contrasts with adult hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients of whom all had positive IgM responses,' the researchers write in the study, which has been submitted to a preprint server and seen by MailOnline.

'For antibody responses, IgM responses develop first, before eventually waning and IgG responses dominating thereafter,' the researchers explain.

'Thus, high levels of IgG in the absence of IgM are typically suggestive of infection weeks or even months previously. '

This antibody test is conducted in a laboratory and is not a portable test. It is also fundamentally different to the test approved by the government today, which is manufactured by Roche.

Roche's method uses a nucleoprotein to mimic the SARS-CoV-2 virus, not the viral spike.

'Using the native-like viral spike for antibody testing is proving a highly sensitive way of detecting exposure to SARS-CoV-2,' Professor Crispin told MailOnline.

The researchers say their research shows that the only way to diagnose patients with symptoms of severe inflammatory syndrome who have tested negative for the PCR is via antibody testing.

Dr Cunningham says: 'In our study, none of the children were positive by PCR, yet all of the children were positive by antibody testing.

'This may mean that the disease developed after the kids have already cleared the virus.

'If so, then serology may be more useful diagnostically for kids who are PCR negative.

'What the antibody test tells us is that these children have definitely been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at some time in the past, which will hopefully help doctors make decisions on how to treat these patients.

'Ultimately, both PCR and antibody testing have overlapping roles to play in diagnosing this syndrome. Really excitingly, the detection of the antibodies may also provide clues on how this syndrome develops.'

As a result of their findings, the researchers suggest changing the definition of PIMS-TS, as the Kawasaki-like condition is now known.

'Since all patients were positive serologically, it may be worth considering amending the definition of PIMS-TS so that TS is not just ""temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"", but ""triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection"",' the researchers conclude in their study.",15,Low,Right
