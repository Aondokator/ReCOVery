Among those items that tested positive for the coronavirus were samples from a goat, a papaya and a pheasant, all at once exposing the total science fraud behind coronavirus testing.

As we’ve warned for over a month, most coronavirus tests produce huge numbers of false positives. The testing kits are largely made in China, and either through gross incompetence or malicious intent, China-made lab tests are notorious for being so inaccurate that they’re practically useless.

Notably, the infamous “Stanford Study” which was seized upon by the conservative media to claim that the coronavirus had already infected a large percentage of the population and therefore wasn’t very deadly also relied in China-made antibody tests that produced huge numbers of false positives. Those who touted the findings of the Stanford Study were actually getting hoodwinked by China, it turns out. And similar antibody tests have been run in New York, allowing Cuomo to spread total disinformation to the public, claiming somewhere around 14% of all New Yorkers have already been infected with the virus.

We now have enough knowledge of the “false positives” testing fiasco to be able to say, with confidence, that the official coronavirus infection numbers are wildly over-stated. Nowhere near that number of people have actually been infected.

And that means the coronavirus is far more deadly than what people are being led to believe.

Why the coronavirus actually kills about 10% of those who become symptomatic

In the United States, the official numbers currently show that 1.35 million people are confirmed as infected, while 80,351 people have so far died from the virus. If you take these numbers at face value, that would put the current Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the coronavirus at 5.9%.

The infection numbers, though, are wildly over-inflated due to faulty testing kits that produce false positives. If we adjust the infection numbers down to a more realistic level, the CFR jumps significantly higher. And yes, there are likely some people dying from other things who have been incorrectly counted as COVID-19 deaths, but the Financial Times analysis of excess mortalities from all causes ends that argument by documenting a huge surge in recent deaths from any cause, regardless of what’s stated on death certificates.

If anything, the number of coronavirus deaths is being under-stated by perhaps 50% or so, while the number of coronavirus infections is being over-stated by a wide margin.

And we actually have a way to take a good guess at the degree by which those infection numbers are over-inflated.

We already know that many of these kits produce somewhere around 10 false positives per 100 people tested, or a 10% false positive rate (many kits are far worse). We can also intelligently estimate that right now somewhere around 2% of the US population has actually been infected. This is a rough estimate, but as you’ll see below, whether this is 1% or 4% doesn’t change the conclusions by much.

Now, if you test 100 people for the coronavirus, and 2 out of those 100 actually have the coronavirus, but the test kits you’re using have a false positive rate of 10 out of 100, then you will get, essentially 12 positives out of 100.

Notably, 10 of those positives are false, and 2 are real. This means the false positives are 500% higher than the real positives. And if you rely on those findings, you would incorrectly think that 500% more people have been infected than actually have.

This is precisely what the Stanford Study did. They ran tests that produced false positives, then they extrapolated that false finding to the entire population of California. From that, they incorrectly concluded that a huge percentage of California had already been infected, and therefore the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of the coronavirus was very, very small. As we show in this Natural News article, Stanford researchers likely produced 13 false positives for every 1 real positive.

That entire conclusion falls apart when you realize the testing kits they used were made in China. In fact, those particular kits were so unreliable that Stanford researchers tried to hide the origins of the kits in their paper, but internet sleuths found out the kits were actually made by Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, a company that ranked last place in testing kit accuracy. As ExtremeTech.com explained:

At the time Stanford did the study, there werenât any FDA-approved COVID-19 antibody tests for clinical use. But for research purposes, the team purchased tests from Premier Biotech in Minnesota. Premier has started marketing a COVID-19 antibody test, but it doesnât create it. The test listed on the companyâs website, and that it appears Stanford used, is from Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, an established Chinese lab test vendor.

It also turned out that the Wall Street Journal writer who touted the stunning findings of the paper was one of the paper co-authors who failed to identify his obvious conflict of interest. So the entire study — and the subsequent WSJ editorial coverage of it — was a rigged scam, 100% science fraud parading around as breaking news to try to deceive America into thinking the coronavirus was no real danger at all. It was a propaganda con job, and sadly, most of the pro-Trump independent media fell for it and repeated the bad conclusions, misinforming their own audiences and causing many people to believe the virus was “no more dangerous than the flu.”

Peak Prosperity also explained this in a detailed video, which I covered in this important podcast:

If you really crunch the numbers on this, it turns out the coronavirus is 56 to 100 times more deadly than the regular flu. But to realize that, you have to weed through the deliberate disinformation being pushed by those who are trying to downplay the severity of the virus for political reasons. (A foolish ploy that will catastrophically backfire when the second wave of infections becomes impossible to deny.)

Bad tests and false positives: The upshot of what it really means

So what does all this really mean in a practical sense? Here are the bullet points of the rational conclusions:

The infection numbers are wildly over-stated due to false positives from bogus testing kits.

This means the infection fatality rates are under-stated, since far fewer people have been infected than we were led to believe.

It also means that herd immunity is far off, since the actual percentage of people who have been infected is much smaller than what researchers have been reporting. In truth, the real number of infections may be just 1/10th what researchers have estimated (or even lower). Any attempt to leap across the chasm and try to rapidly achieve herd immunity in the USA will result in disaster (and mass death).

This also means that reopening economies without taking proper precautions — such as wearing masks, which can end the pandemic if just 80% of the people participate — will lead to a catastrophic second round of infections and deaths.

Finally, and perhaps most worryingly, this means that people are being told they’ve already been infected and are therefore immune and can go back to work. When, in reality, most of those people have never been infected at all. This will result in many people having a false sense of security, which would likely lead many of these people to avoid taking adequate precautions such as wearing masks.

In effect, the result of bad tests producing false positives is mass confusion and the gross mis-allocation of resources to fight the pandemic. If that sounds like the precise scenario that communist China would be trying to unleash across America as part of a biological warfare playbook, you’re exactly right.

That’s why we believe the false positive test kits are deliberately manufactured to be faulty as a way for China to magnify the spread of the coronavirus pandemic outside of China as part of its multiple waves of biological warfare against the West.

Almost certainly, China reserved the accurate kits for itself while exporting known “bad” kits to nations like the United States, all while pressuring the WHO to claim there was no pandemic at all.

1,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-04-26-bombshell-financial-times-analysis-totaly-mortality-surging-covid-19.html,Natural News,2020-04-26,['Mike Adams'],"Bombshell Financial Times analysis reveals total deaths are surging worldwide, regardless of what’s on the death certificates… 50 percent surge in total mortality points to common cause: COVID-19",https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/04/Coronavirus-Woman-Hospital-Doctors-Respirator.jpg,"(Natural News) Beginning in March, as the pandemic denialism movement started gaining steam, the naysayers started arguing that all the “covid-19 deaths” were actually just people who would have died anyway. All the death certificates were being switched to coronavirus, they said, to fake the coronavirus deaths.

This argument continues to this day. In effect, most of the independent media is now claiming that there is no net increase in global mortality whatsoever, and that all the people who are said to have died from covid-19 actually died from other causes. The coronavirus “hysteria,” they say, is a global false flag event that’s being staged by 100+ nations and hundreds of thousands of complicit doctors and nurses in order to enslave the human race under medical tyranny.

The Financial Times just released a detailed, bombshell analysis of global mortality that obliterates that denialist argument. By studying detailed mortality statistics across over a dozen countries and prominent cities (such as NYC), the Financial Times was able to document a global pattern of 50 percent excess mortality from any cause, showing that something is suddenly killing hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, regardless of what’s on death certificates.

The Financial Times even concluded that the global death toll from covid-19 should actually be over 300,000 deaths, not the roughly 200,000 that are currently claimed as “official” deaths. In other words, as you’ll see from the charts below, it’s almost certain that official death counts are underestimating the real coronavirus deaths by at least a third.

From the FT:

To calculate excess deaths, the FT has compared deaths from all causes in the weeks of a locationâs outbreak in March and April 2020 to the average for the same period between 2015 and 2019.Â The total of 122,000 amounts to a 50 per cent rise in overall mortality relative to the historical average for the locations studied.

In other words, the FT looks at total deaths from any cause and found sudden surges in deaths that obviously coincide with the coronavirus pandemic.

Here are just a few of the charts from the FT analysis. You can see all of them at the FT website.

First, New York City shows a +299% overall mortality compared to all causes of death from the previous year:

What this tells us is that something caused a huge, sudden spike in deaths in New York City. We wonder, what could it be?

These data are further supported by a statistics website known as Indexmundi.com, which tracks the average, normal death rates on a state-by-state basis throughout the USA. According to Indexmundi.com, New York State normally sees 441 deaths per day, without any pandemic.

But during the coronavirus surge, New York State saw a 299% increase in total deaths from any cause, as shown by the FT chart above.

If we search the globe for what might be killing New Yorkers in such huge numbers, all clustered in about a 30-day period, the answer should be obvious. It’s not a hurricane. Not a tornado. Not an earthquake. Not a nuclear bomb. Not mass food poisoning, etc. There’s only one thing that is simultaneously surging around the world, causing huge spikes in total deaths, regardless of what’s on birth certificates: Covid-19.

Here’s the same look at a similar surge in Guayas province, Ecuador, where Guayaquil is located. There, a +347% surge in deaths was documented by studying cemetery records:

Northern Italy experience a very similar surge in total mortality during a slightly earlier time period, tracking a +463% in total deaths. As the Financial Times writes:

In the northern Italian region of Lombardy, the heart of Europeâs worst outbreak, there are more than 13,000 excess deaths in the official statistics for the nearly 1,700 municipalities for which data is available. This is an uptick of 155 per cent on the historical average and far higher than the 4,348 reported Covid deaths in the region.

For the Bergamo province, the increase was +463%.

What could it be?

What common event could be causing a surge of deaths in New York City, Northern Italy, Guayaquil and even Madrid, Spain?

The answer is obvious, of course: It’s the coronavirus pandemic.

Here’s a zoomed-out snapshot of about a dozen other nations showing a similar pattern. For the higher-res graphics, visit the FT article link, above:

What’s even more astonishing is that the lockdowns that have been put in place to try to stem the tide of the pandemic have lowered deaths from other causes such as car accidents and workplace injuries. As a result, the mortality surges shown in these charts don’t fully capture the number of deaths attributable to coronavirus, since some of the overall mortality has been suppressed by lockdown activity.

That means the global deaths stemming from covid-19 are higher than 300,000. As FT explains it:

Even the much higher numbers of deaths in the pandemic suggested by excess mortality statistics are likely to be conservative, as lockdowns mean that âmortality from numerous conditions such as traffic accidents and occupational injuries possibly went down,â said MarkÃ©ta PechholdovÃ¡, assistant professor of demography at the University of Economics, Prague.

This means the global case fatality rate for the coronavirus is likely above 10%

The upshot of all this is that, once again, we have solid scientific evidence — mortality records and mortuary records — showing that the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the coronavirus is likely above 10%. The only way that’s not true is if you can come up with an alternate explanation of what could possibly be killing so many people, nearly all at the same time, following exponential math, in multiple nations all across the world, sharing virtually identical symptoms that correspond to covid-19.

Right now, there are just under 3 million people who have been confirmed infected with the coronavirus. Even if we generously assume every one of those people is symptomatic, qualifying them as a “case,” the 300,000 worldwide deaths now carefully calculated by the Financial Times put the global Case Fatality Rate at slightly over 10%.

This is, in fact, strikingly similar to the 5.6 – 10% Case Fatality Rate we calculated from other available numbers, without even having the benefit of the Financial Times mortality investigations.

For the record, the “Case Fatality Rate” means the percentage of people who die after becoming symptomatic and diagnosed with the infection. See a full explanation of the difference between the CFR and the IFR at this link on Science.news.

Pandemic denialists routinely obfuscate the difference between CFR and IFR, falsely comparing the IFR of the coronavirus with the CFR of the seasonal flu to try to claim the coronavirus is “no more dangerous than the flu.” The comparison is intellectually dishonest and smacks of scientific illiteracy, which seems common among the pandemic denialists.

I’ve offered a detailed explanation of CFR vs. IFR in this new podcast that’s worth a listen:

What all this means is that the coronavirus is likely 100 times more deadly than the flu. While the regular flu kills less than 0.1% of those who are symptomatic (i.e. “cases”), the coronavirus is currently killing at least 10% of those who are confirmed as infected, even when those infection numbers are surely too high because they include non-symptomatic people who shouldn’t even be considered in this equation.

The upshot is that the coronavirus Case Fatality Rate is likely above 10%, not below it.

In other words, at least 1 out of every 10 people who become symptomatic with a coronavirus infection end up dying from it. Anyone claiming the coronavirus is “no more dangerous than the flu” isn’t taking an honest look at the mortality numbers.

Concluded coronavirus cases currently show a global Case Fatality Rate of 19%

Right now, Worldometers.info data show that out of all the closed cases — which currently stands at about 1.1 million — a whopping 19% of those resulted in death. The other 81% resulted in patients being discharged or recorded as recovered.

While we expect that 19% number to settle somewhat as more patients who are currently hospitalized find their way to recovery, based on the global mortality figured now uncovered by the Financial Times, it’s becoming abundantly clear that the coronavirus is at least 100 times more deadly than the regular flu. It kills at least 1 out of 10 who are symptomatic, while the regular flu kills not even 1 in 1,000. (The actual Case Fatality Rate for the regular flu, based on publicly available CDC data, is 34,157 / 35,520,883. And that comes to less than 1 in 1,000, or 0.096%.)

This means that ending lockdowns prematurely or without adequate precautions will lead to catastrophe

The upshot of all this is that most people continue to vastly underestimate the danger of the coronavirus. As they are demanding an end to the lockdowns, they are looking at the wrong numbers (the IFR instead of the CFR), and they aren’t yet aware of the sudden 50% surge in global mortality that has no other explanation besides covid-19.

As I wrote on Natural News yesterday, this means lockdowns will likely be ended without adequate precautions, and this will lead to a catastrophic second wave of new infections approximately 6 – 8 weeks after the lockdowns end.

By early July, in other words, US states that ended the lockdowns on May 1st without calling for mandatory mask policies will be seeing a second wave of new infections, hospitalizations and deaths.

Thus, the deniers and naysayers are delivering the nation right back into the hands of the vaccine pushers and the lockdown authoritarians. By failing to take the virus seriously, they push complacency and denialism that can only lead to more lockdowns and economic decimation.

As I wrote in that article:

The determined effort of media pundits and publishers to try to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic will go down in history as one of the most bizarre and inexplicable chapters in the history of journalism.

But research, mathematics and real science don’t matter to the deniers. They aren’t processing anything with logic and reason. They are expressing an emotional response to the lockdowns, completely absent any defensible logic or reason.

Thus, we can all expect to be forced to endure a second wave of infections, deaths, lockdowns and economic destruction a few months down the road since almost no one took the virus seriously when they didn’t “feel like it.”

The outcome that’s being set up by all the complacency is, of course, a devastating stock market crash in the August – October time frame, followed by Trump losing the November election, followed by uprisings and protests that may lead us directly into civil war or social chaos, just in time for a Democrat to be sworn in next January, immediately followed by full-blown socialism, skyrocketing taxes and a vindictive crackdown on free speech, the Second Amendment and health freedom.

When it all comes down, just remember: Those who didn’t take this seriously set these events into motion. They begged to “reopen the economy” at all costs. They should be careful what they ask for, because they won’t like the price they will ultimately have to pay for their shortsightedness.

I tried to stop all this from happening, but the lunatic mob of denialists doesn’t want to listen to reason.

Late last night, Facebook began banning all links from Brighteon.com, regardless of the content of the videos, claiming that videos about gardening and smoothie recipes and backyard chickens now violate Facebook’s “community guidelines.”

The real reason for the banning, of course, is that Brighteon.com hosts the “Plandemic” video featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits who warns about the dangers of the coronavirus vaccine. Users have posted a Portuguese version of the documentary that has achieved nearly a million views, and a Greek language version is also rapidly gaining hundreds of thousands of views.

The rapid explosion in people viewing the video has resulted in Facebook blacklisting the entire Brighteon platform, confirming Facebook is engaged in anti-trust behavior to try to crush competing platforms by starving them of user traffic. This is blatant criminal anti-trust behavior on the part of Facebook, and it is a direct attack on human knowledge and human freedom.

Even more importantly, both Facebook and YouTube now openly claim that any content which contradicts the “official” opinions of the W.H.O. will be banned, meaning Facebook and YouTube are now run by communist China, because that’s the anti-human rights regime that dictates the policies of the W.H.O.

Facebook scrubs all Natural News content posted since November of 2019

Adding to the extreme, punitive censorship, Facebook also banned all links from NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com while scrubbing all the content we have posted, back to November of 2019, which is the month in which the Wuhan coronavirus bioweapon was released by communist China.

Any attempt to post any link from Natural News or NewsTarget is now blocked by Facebook, and Facebook has scrubbed all our posts about the coronavirus in order to cover up communist China’s war against humanity.

In effect, Facebook is now covering up the bioweapons crimes of communist China by banning independent media publishers that are documenting China’s deliberate engineering and release of this weapon against humanity.

This puts Mark Zuckerberg in the same class as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, actively carrying out crimes against humanity and defending an anti-human regime that builds weapons of mass destruction to cause mass death on a global scale. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of humanity and a criminal against all who value life and liberty.

We repeat our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and other tech giant CEOs that have engaged in malicious, anti-human censorship that protects communist China and the vaccine industry.

How to share the Plandemic video on Facebook and other platforms without getting banned

Because of the extreme level of criminal censorship being carried out by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and even Vimeo, the only current way to share Plandemic videos from Brighteon.com or other targeted platforms is to embed the videos on another website page, then share that page.

Each video on Brighteon.com has a “share” link at the bottom right-hand corner:

From the share link, you can copy either the direct link to the video play page or get embed code that embeds the video into any web page. This code can be pasted into the HTML code of any page, including pages that are edited in WordPress or other page editors.

Here’s an example of the embed code for the Plandemic video from the “Jesus Social” channel on Brighteon:

<iframe src=’https://www.brighteon.com/embed/45c1558c-4163-4961-9f92-11c7c4c1af21′ width=’560′ height=’315′ frameborder=’0′ allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here’s the embedded video it produces when you add this code to your web page:

Once the video is embedded in your page, you can then share that page on Facebook or other platforms.

You can also, of course, share Brighteon links on Gab.com and other alternative internet ecosystems that aren’t run by evil globalists working for communist China.

In the future, we will also have alternate URLs and domain names that will allow you to share Brighteon videos, but those domains will of course be eventually banned by Facebook and the other tech giants, all of which are criminal operations that are complicit in communist China’s war against humanity.

The tech giants will not stop until they succeed in destroying humanity and achieving mass death across the globe

We have now arrived at a very dark chapter in human history where the gatekeepers who control online speech are protecting the very communist regime that has declared war on humanity through the deliberate deployment of engineered bioweapons. Mark Zuckerberg and other big tech globalists are criminals against humanity, and they no longer even pretend to support free speech. Instead, they brazenly censor all platforms and publishers that are working to blow the whistle on global criminals who wield weapons of mass destruction against the innocent.

This is why today, we are repeating our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, YouTube, Twitter and Vimeo for their conspiracy against humankind and their deliberate, malicious crimes against human freedom and human survival.

Human freedom cannot coexist with these evil, anti-human regimes. We either dismantle the tech giants and imprison their architects and leaders, or humanity dies in darkness.

Even if it is his last act, President Trump must deploy military police to arrest the CEOs of the tech giants and prosecute them under military tribunals for their crimes against humanity. Trump must order the US State Department to seize the domain names of all the tech giants engaged in malicious censorship, halting their operations until they restore First Amendment protections on their platforms. In just 24 hours, Trump could order the US government to seize Google.com, Apple.com, Twitter.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com and all the other domains run by the techno-fascists, and he could force them to either respect the First Amendment or be permanently put out of business.

And no, that isn’t tyranny on the part of government, not when the only demand is that tech platforms must respect the freedoms described in the Bill of Rights. For the free world to thrive, Sec. 230 must be dismantled and free speech must be affirmed across the internet, or humanity has no future other than death and tyranny.

That’s the whole plan behind the coronavirus, of course: To unleash mass death, tyranny and censorship, carrying out a new holocaust against billions of innocent people so that globalists can achieve their depopulation dreams.

Watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits to find out why globalists are so afraid of this woman that they are blacklisting entire platforms to prevent her voice from being heard:

The neighboring Grand Teton National Park, located about 10 miles south of Yellowstone, has also been reopened.

At noon on May 18, Yellowstone began its first phase of reopening by allowing visitors to enter through the park’s south and east entrances. The park had been closed since March due to the ravaging effects of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

The visitors, many of whom weren’t wearing face masks or practicing social distancing, flocked to Yellowstone as soon as it opened. Many of the visitors were observed, according to the license plates of the cars, to be from far away states, such as Washington State, New York and even Alaska.

âWe have been cooped up for weeks,â said Jacob Willis, who was interviewed byÂ The Guardian. Willis was among a crowd of onlookers at the Old Faithful Geyser. âWhen the parks opened, we jumped at the opportunity to travel,â he added. He had arrived from Florida.

Signs and handouts provided by park authorities cautioned park visitors to wear face masks and to observe social distancing by staying at least six feet away from other visitors. The park is also only open for day use. Food, campsite and lodging services, as well as the visitor centers have also remained closed.

Only the park’s entrances in Wyoming have been opened. Yellowstone National Park officials are still in negotiations with authorities in Idaho and Montana over opening the entrances to the park in their respective states. However, it seems unlikely for the Montana entrances to open in the near future, as the state requires out-of-state visitors to observe a mandatory 14-day quarantine. (Related: As the lockdowns are lifted, don’t forget these 10 basic FACTS about the Wuhan coronavirus, or we’ll all suffer a catastrophic second wave of deaths planned by the globalists.)

Listen to theÂ Health Ranger ReportÂ by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he callsÂ to end the lockdowns and launch the takedowns.

âNot a single mask in sightâ

While many, including President Trump, have celebrated the reopening of Yellowstone National Park, others have raised concerns, especially upon observing the large mass of visitors who entered the national park on May 18.

Some of the concerns include the potential for large groups of visitors toÂ willfully skirt social distancing guidelines, to not wear face masks and for out-of-state visitors to possibly cause a new outbreak in their respective home states.

Kristin Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), stated that she and her colleagues checked camera footage at Old Faithful on Monday afternoon.

âNot much physical distancing happening and not a single mask in sight,â said Brengel.

Brian Perry, supervisor of Yellowstone’s eastern entrance, said that about 300 cars entered the park in the first three hours, and around 500 were expected by the day’s end. This, park officials have said, is about average for an opening day. Tour buses and other large commercial vehicles are still not allowed into the park.

âThe park’s goal is to open safely and conservatively, ensure we take the right actions to reduce risks to our employees and visitors and help local economies begin to recover,â said Cam Sholly, superintendent for Yellowstone.

Other national parks beginning to reopen

Along with Yellowstone and Grand Teton, 20 other national parks were reopened for potential visitors on Monday, such as Zion National Park in Utah, Joshua Tree and Redwood National Parks in California and Everglades National Park in Florida.

Furthermore, an additional 11 parks are scheduled to reopen either at the tail end of May or sometime in June or July, such as the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado and the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona.

Many of these parks, once they do reopen, will have limited capacity for their reopening. Many hotels, restaurants and visitor centers, much like those in Yellowstone, will remain closed. All restaurants and stores in Grand Teton National Park, for example, are closed, but many of the park’s biking and hiking trails have reopened.

Some travel experts have also warned visitors against going to the more popular national parks, such as Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, especially on holidays, such as the coming Memorial Day, as they will most likely be packed with large crowds, increasing visitors’ risk of contracting COVID-19.

Marty Behr, a travel specialist, suggested that people who do want to visit a national park consider some of the less well-known ones.

âIn Utah, everyone knows Arches and Canyonlands, but Capitol Reef is a spectacular area with bison trails, petroglyphs, and great hiking and it gets way less visitors than the others,â said Behr, who further suggested that, instead of going to a national park, travelers who want to get out of their homes could visit monuments instead, such as the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in southern Utah.

Concerns raised over national park employees’ abilities to halt potential spread of coronavirus among visitors

Many people have raised concerns about the reopening of the United States’ national parks. Superintendent Sholly has stated that, if a crowd refuses to practice social distancing, he will choose not to put his staff at risk by having them join the crowd to attempt to disperse them.

Phil Francis, chair of The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, an advocacy group of current, former and retired national parks employees dedicated to promoting America’s national parks, has stated his disagreement with this kind of approach when it came to parks visitors.

Due to furloughs and budget cuts made at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, national parks have to rely more and more on visitors to be personally responsible for how they behave. Despite this, Francis hopes that the country’s parks system can take a more active approach in safeguarding the health of visitors and that, if the opening leads to the spread of the virus, park superintendents will be allowed to shut down parks once again.

That being said, Fracis, Behr and other experts are in agreement that, if visitors are not under lockdown orders, are feeling healthy, have done their research, abide by health guidelines such as the wearing of face masks and practicing social distancing and pledge to be responsible visitors, then there should be no reason they can’t take a trip down to Yellowstone, Grand Teton or any other national park.

Almost every facet of the global economy is at a standstill and large portions of the global population are being forced to stay indoors. This has led to less air pollution, less car traffic and a marked improvement in environmental conditions all over the world.

Because of this, bee populations in bee farms across the globe are finally thriving after years of decline, especiallyÂ some of the largest bee farms in the United Kingdom.

Helen McGregor, a beekeeper working for Denrosa Apiaries, a bee farm in Scotland, said that the current lockdowns have made people more aware of the insects’ role in nature.

Denrosa Apiaries is the biggest bee farm in Britain. It currently has over 4,000 bee hives, each with a population of around 50,000 bees.

âLess traffic, less pollution is bound to make a difference to the environment which of course has a positive knock-on effect for bees,â said McGregor. âHopefully we see these changes lasting.â

A vibrant bee farm isn’t just great for bees â it’s great forÂ whole ecosystems. McGregor states that many farmers who live near Denrosa Apiaries’ six different sites depend on the bees to help pollinate their crops.

âIt’s very early in our season to say what production is going to be like but the bees are busy bringing back nectar and pollen.â

I took these on 4/11, but our honey bees are THRIVING rn. These little creatures are so sensitive to everything but in the middle of a pandemic ours have been doing better than they ever have in the past 8 years. #SavetheBees bc weâd be in worse shape than we are now w/o them. pic.twitter.com/62s0IEyKq9 — Hannah (@gracehannah317) May 13, 2020

Fewer cars, less air pollution means fewer bee deaths

In North America alone, it is estimated that around 24 billion bees and wasps are killed every year due to colliding with vehicles on roads. The lack of air pollution from vehicles and factories is also contributing greatly to the health of the bees.

Mark Brown, professor of evolutionary ecology atÂ Royal Holloway, University of London, said that the lack of air pollution means bees can better care for their young. Furthermore, the lack of pollutants in the air helps bees detect floral scents, leading to them being able to pollinateÂ plants easier.

As the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic are forcing local governments in the U.K. to enact budget cuts, many have ceased maintaining road verges, the neat and usually trimmed strips of vegetation that line roads. This, in turn, has turned these strips into lush habitats where flowers can bloom, which is great for bees, who are reaping the benefits of their new and unexpected sources of food.

In fact, this may help Brown and other ecologists in the U.K., as they have been campaigning for local governments â councils, as they are often referred to â to allow the vegetation in road verges to grow. Not only is this beneficial for the environment, but councils won’t have to spend money hiring people to keep the grass trimmed.

A thriving bee population is also very good for the economy, especially since they fertilize around a third of all food grown and 80 percent of the world’s flowering plants. According to one study from theÂ University of Reading,Â bees and other pollinating creatures have a global economic value of around $150 billion.

Governments around the world have a clear, financial incentive to maintain healthy, bee-filled environments. Fortunately, people with small gardens in their backyards can also help keep local bee populations healthy.

Listen to theÂ Health Ranger ReportÂ as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about the importance of fortifying your food stocks through gardening.

âResilience gardensâ and other kinds of backyard andÂ community gardens can boost local bee populations

During World Wars I and II, Canadian civilians planted âresilience gardensâ in their yards as a way to support local food production, which then supported their soldiers fighting abroad. As the coronavirus pandemic has weakened the world’s food networks, perhaps it is time to bring this trend back and to begin planting gardens to protect communities against food supply issues.

Starting a garden, especially in urban areas, either in a back or front yard or in a communal plot of land, can help mitigate food security issues. With the rise in bee populations, first-time urban gardeners can use this to their advantage, as food crops are heavily dependent on wild insects such as bees, flies and butterflies to help pollinate their crops.

However, not all bee species are beneficial for food security.

Canada, for example, has over 850 native species of bees. However, the non-native common European honeybee has put the country’s native bee populations at risk, as studies have indicated that the European honeybee may be transmitting diseases and causing previously common Canadian bee species to become endangered.

This can have long-term impacts on the pollination of not just food crops, but also native plants. This, in turn, can have a disastrous impact on urban food security.

By planting a resilience garden in a yard, a rooftop or a communal plant of land, native bee species can be enticed to return and flourish in areas where they haven’t entered in a long time.

This creates a positive feedback loop, as local bee populations thrive, gardens can become more plentiful, which supports the bee populations.

Resilience gardens can be grownÂ almost anywhere in a city, from balconies to vacant lots and rooftops.Â Gardens support native biodiversity, provide many mental health benefits and can give people under lockdown a chance to be active and interact with nature.

Importantly, they create communities that are fortified against the food shortages that are threatening the world â and it’s all thanks to the busy little pollinators that are now being given a chance to heal and grow.

We are talking about billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates, of course, who reportedly offered a $10 million bribe to the Nigerian House of Representatives in exchange for gaining access to Nigerian children whom he could experiment on with a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

All the House had to do was pass a bill presented by Gates that would have mandated the vaccination of all Nigerians with an experimental Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine created by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and its drug partners.

Thankfully, opposition political parties quickly rejected this proposed eugenics and possible genocide attempt, and even threatened the Speaker of the House with impeachment if he agreed to Gates’ bribe.

It was the Nigerian Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) that says it intercepted a human intelligence report detailing how the Nigerian House of Representatives was right on the verge of selling out its people when the scheme was unearthed, bringing it to a halt.

The House was not only poised to pass the Gates bill, but it was planning to do so outside the bounds of the traditional legislative process. In other words, it was a back-door deal done under the cover of darkness to advance the vaccination dreams of Bill Gates.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, unpacks the plan to depopulate the world, in part through mass vaccination:

Is Bill Gates Satan in the flesh?

In a statement, opposition spokesman Barrister Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere chastised the House for even considering accepting Gates’ offer, no matter the sum of money. He further threatened to unseat Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila for his complicity in the horrific plot.

“Opposition Coalition (CUPP) has intercepted very credible intelligence and hereby alerts Nigerians of plans by the leadership of the House of Representatives led by Femi Gbajabiamila to forcefully and without adherence to the rules of lawmaking to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill 2020 otherwise known as the Compulsory Vaccination Bill which is proposing a compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered,” that statement reads.

“This intelligence is coupled with the information of the alleged receipt, from sources outside the country but very interested in the Bill, of the sum of $10 million by the sponsors and promoters of the Bill to distribute among lawmakers to ensure a smooth passage of the Bill.”

Great Game India reports that the alleged deal to secretly and illegally pass this sellout bill was hatched during a legislative trip to Austria a few months back. The financial boost was later added to get the bill moving more quickly, and to get it passed by any means necessary.

“Nigerians are reminded that at present, there is no discovered/approved vaccine anywhere in the world and one now begins to wonder why the hurry to pass a Bill for a compulsory vaccine when there is none,” Great Game India further adds about how a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine does not even exist.

Meanwhile, Sara Cunial, a prominent Italian politician, has spoken out calling for the arrest of Bill Gates. She says that he is a “vaccine criminal” who needs to be handed over to the International Criminal Court to be tried for his many crimes against humanity.

Cunial also played a critical role in exposing Gates’ genocidal efforts in India and other countries throughout Africa, which include plans to use vaccinations to deliver microchips into people’s bodies as part of his nefarious ID2020 program.

The research team, led by engineering professor Dibakar Bhattacharyya, will be working with the universityâsÂ Center of Membrane Sciences and with other collaborators to make these masks a reality.

The endowment, which provides $150,000 over one year, is part of the NSFâs Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant, which has recently called for immediate proposals to head off the spread of coronavirus. For the new project, the team will developÂ porous and spongy structures with charged domains and enzymes, and use these to create masks and other flat sheet materials that willÂ capture and deactivate SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus strain responsible for COVID-19.

The masks work by targeting âs-proteinâ spikes in the coronavirus. These spikes, in particular, are what give the virus its crownlike appearance. As the coronavirus enters the mask, it will pass through a new membrane filled with proteolytic enzymes. These enzymes will then attach to the spikes of the coronavirus and separate them, effectively killing it.

âWe have the capability to create a membrane that would not only effectively filter out the novel coronavirus like the N95 mask does, but deactivate the virus completely,â Bhattacharyya added.

âThis innovation would further slow and even prevent the virus from spreading. It would also have future applications to protect against a number of human pathogenic viruses.â

The new membrane, developed by theÂ National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, is the latest in âfunctionalized membranes,âÂ or highly specialized layers that can interact with undesired particles, like viruses, through selective binding or deactivation.

The process for developing and testing the masks will take around six months. After the masks are green-lit, the work will then be shored up toÂ a large-scale membrane manufacturer, which the team has an existing collaboration with. (Related:Â Wearing masks to block the coronavirus is going to become the new normal.)

âWe have great resources at our fingertips and many opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research across disciplines,â Bhattacharyya said.

âOur researchers work together and lend their expertise to solve challenges for the greater good of humanity, not only at a time like this, but every day.â

Making reusable masks to fight the contagion

The masks developed by theÂ University of KentuckyÂ is just one of many masks that are beingÂ builtÂ to battle the deadly coronavirus, which has since infected 4.8 million people around the worldÂ and killed over 321,000, according to data fromÂ Johns Hopkins University.

In particular, a maskÂ developed byÂ Stanford University researcher Manu Prakash uses face-snorkel masks to create reusable masks for health workers on the front lines. The mask, which he named Pneumask, has already received feedback from theÂ Food and Drug Authority.Â

Currently, Prakash and his lab are working with other scientists and manufacturers in the U.S., as well as those in France, Italy and Chile, to build, test and launch the Pneumask.

âYou hear that manufacturers are trying to ramp up supplies of N95 masks, but the reality is that everybody is fighting for this precious resource,â he said.

âThis is a very unfortunate situation, and I wish we werenât in this position, but we are. So we have to do everything that we can to find new solutions.â

7,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-20-texas-highest-one-day-increase-in-coronavirus-cases.html,Natural News,2020-05-20,['Ralph Flores'],Texas saw its highest one-day increase in new coronavirus cases over the weekend,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/USA-night-lights-600.png,"(Natural News) Over the past weekend,Â Texas, North Carolina and Arizona have all reported a steady increase in new cases, raising concerns on whether reopening early can lead to more damaging consequences.

Texas reportedÂ 1,801 new cases on Saturday, its largest one day-increase in cases.Â North Carolina also saw its largest single-day jump, with 853 new cases on the same day. Meanwhile, Arizona reported 462 new cases, close to a record high. In addition, dataÂ from theÂ New York TimesÂ revealed that weekly rolling averagesÂ in new cases in all three states have also been rising.

According to public health experts, these figures reveal the challenges that come with reopening amid the pandemic. Texas and Arizona are already well underway withÂ their reopening efforts,Â with states allowing restaurants and barbershops to reopen, provided they follow strict social distancing measures. North Carolina is following their lead, entering its first phase of reopening by allowing retail stores to reopen with restrictions.

Upswing in cases due to more testing

State officials, however, noted that the recent upswing in cases wasÂ also caused by an increase in testing. This meant that more people with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are being identified.

Still, the steady increase in cases — even with testing — is concerning, according toÂ NorthÂ Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen. During a press briefing on Monday, she added that these figures come at a time when restrictions were being eased.

âWhen we see this kind of an increase in case counts, we also know that we are easing restrictions and folks are moving around more,â Cohen said.

She also urgedÂ residents to wear face masks, observe social distancing and wash their hands, even with more relaxed measures in place.

Not all states who reopened early are reporting an upswing in cases. Georgia, which lifted its shelter-in-place orders on April 30, has not seen a spike in cases, while Floridaâs has been mostly flat.Â Itâs still too early to tell if state measures are working, as coronavirus data has a two-week lag. Similarly, it also takes time for a person with coronavirus to develop symptoms and get tested, which further complicates caseload data.

Itâs also worth noting that while data from the national level shows a decline in new cases, the trendlines can greatly differ when adjusted for regional variation. In recent weeks, health authorities in New Jersey and New York — the latter being the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. — have reported significant declines in new cases.

In statements released by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, they stressed that increased testing accounted for the upswing in new cases in their states.

All three states, however, have relatively low positivity rates in their testing,Â with both Texas and Arizona atÂ five percent, and North Carolina at aroundÂ six percent. The states have also expressed confidence in theirÂ hospital capacity, a key metric when it comes to handling the coronavirus. (Related:Â As the lockdowns are lifted, donât forget these 10 basic FACTS about the Wuhan coronavirus, or weâll all suffer a catastrophic second wave of deaths planned by the globalists.)

Calculated risks

Health experts say that reopening the economy can lead to an increase in cases, especially as people start to interact more and spread the virus.

âIt is not surprising that we are seeing more reported cases given that we have started to reopen, people are more mobile and weâre doing a lot more testing,âÂ explained Aaron McKethan, a senior policy fellow at Duke University.

In a Senate testimony last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci,Â director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, echoed a similar warning, saying that reopening too soon can lead to spikes in new cases and serious consequences.

Experts have also called for a balance between public health and the economy as stay-at-home orders canât last forever.

âIf we were only looking at public health considerations, we would of course maintain lockdown indefinitely, but thatâs not feasible,â McKethan said.

For Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health professor Michael Mina, the U.S. is on the brink of collapse if the economy doesnât reopen soon, despite the concerns from a health standpoint.

âMyself and many of my colleagues are very nervous about this idea of opening up this early, without the right pieces in place, but it does need to happen,â he added.

The ruling came Monday in response to a suit brought by churches claiming that social distancing rules were unconstitutional. Emergency powers, they argued, are only in effect for a month before needing legislative approval, which these orders never received, and Baker County Circuit Judge Matthew Shirtcliff ruled in their favor.

In his seven-page opinion, Shirtcliff had stated that the damage to peopleâs livelihoods surpassed the dangers posed by the disease. The ruling meant that not only would church gatherings for worship be okay, but so would all outings within the state, potentially causing a serious health crisis.

Governor Brown said that she would appeal the ruling right away in order to âsafeguard the health of all Oregonians â including frontline health care workers, those living in nursing homes, workers in agriculture and food processing plants, and Oregonians with underlying health conditions…”

True to her word, just hours later, she was able to get the Oregon Supreme Court to stop the rural judgeâs order and keep the stay-at-home order in place for the time being. The new decision will stay the judgeâs decree pending a review by high court justices.

Governor Brown praised the Supreme Court for its action in a statement, saying that moving too quickly to pre-pandemic life could bring the state back to the beginning of the outbreak when hospitals faced major shortages.

Brown declared a state of emergency in Oregon on March 8 due to coronavirus and has since issued several executive orders, including one that closed all schools, nonessential businesses and dine-in services at bars and restaurants. She extended the order by a further 60 days earlier this month until July 6. However, quite a few counties have already been given approval by the state to start loosening their restrictions to some degree.

Oregon isnât the only state whose stay-at-home orders have been the target of legal action. A North Carolina federal judge came down on the side of conservative Christian leaders by blocking the enforcement of Governor Ray Cooperâs restrictions affecting religious services indoors.

Last week, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin struck down the governorâs stay-at-home orders on the grounds that the administration had overstepped its authority by extending the order for an additional month without consulting lawmakers.

In contrast, states like New York, Washington and California give governors broader power during public health emergencies.

States could be in for a âvicious cycleâ of health and economic disasters

Some states are starting to reopen to various degrees, even as models indicate that doing so will lead to a rise in infections and deaths throughout the next few weeks. An uptick in cases is being noted in places like Texas, Alabama and South Dakota, where restrictions have already started to loosen.

The World Health Organization has warned that easing restrictions too quickly and reopening the economy could create a âvicious cycleâ of health and economic disasters.

WHO Emergencies Program Executive Director Dr. Mike Ryan stated: âThis is what we all fear, is a vicious cycle of public health disaster followed by economic disaster followed by public health disaster followed by economic disaster.â

Although the first amendment protects Americansâ right to practice their religion, there are ways to practice that right that do not put countless people in danger of contracting a deadly illness.

The Archbishop of Baltimore, William Lori, reminded Catholics that what is going on is not a violation of religious liberty, and said arguing otherwise puts lives at risk. He said government orders are âeminently reasonableâ and do not undermine peopleâs faith.

These are unprecedented times, and protecting as many lives as possible should be everyoneâs priority â especially when there are safer ways of practicing oneâs religion.

9,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-20-florida-health-manager-forced-to-hide-coronavirus.html,Natural News,2020-05-20,['Franz Walker'],Florida Health Department manager forced to quit after being told to HIDE coronavirus data,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Coronavirus-United-States-Map-Spread-Covid-19.jpg,"(Natural News) A top data manager at Floridaâs Department of HealthÂ resigned afterÂ being told to hide vital data about the number of COVID-19 cases in the state. According to internal emails obtained by theÂ Tampa Bay Times, Rebekah Jones hadÂ objected to the removal of records showing whether people had symptoms of positive tests before the cases were announced.

The emails reveal thatÂ department staff gave the order after reporters had asked for the data on May 5. Jones, the departmentâs geographic information systems manager, complied with the order, but not before telling her supervisors that it was the âwrong call.â

The next day, control over the data was given to other employees. Jones wrote in an email, posted Friday on a public listserv, that she was no longer handling questions about the departmentâsÂ âFloridaâs COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard,âÂ and implied that her removal was an act of retribution.

On Tuesday, Jones said that she was offered a settlement and the option to resign instead of being fired, effective May 26.

Changes to Floridaâs coronavirus dashboard

The COVID-19 dashboard that Jones managed is the best source of data on how the Wuhan coronavirus is moving through Florida. Without access to it, people in Florida would have to rely on the word of politicians and officials without the ability to verify it for themselves.

In addition to the dashboard, the department also releases the same data, with slightly more information, in the form of daily reports that allow for easier data analysis.

With what happened to her, however, Jones is now questioning whether people can continue to trust the data on the dashboard.

âAs a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it,â she wrote.

âThey are making a lot of changes. I would advise being diligent in your respective uses of this data.â

Important field removed

Emails sent on May 4 indicate a busy timeline leading up to Jonesâ reassignment and eventual termination.

According to the Miami Herald, reportersÂ contacted the department that day to ask about the âEventDateâ field of data, which showed when people first reported coronavirus symptoms or positive test results.Â ThisÂ field listed dates as far back as January 1, indicating that people had the virus much earlier than when the first cases were confirmed in March.

OnÂ that same day, however, the field disappeared from the âPerson Casesâ data, which lists anonymized records for every confirmed case in the state. TheÂ Tampa Bay times, which automatically checks for changes in the data and archives any updates, noted that the EventDate field had disappeared from the data by 3:02 pm on May 4. (Related:Â STUPID-19 strikes again: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp releases rigged coronavirus chart that scrambles dates to create false impression of infection decline.)

DeSantisÂ addressed Jonesâ termination but dodged questions

During a news conferenceÂ Tuesday addressing Jonesâ public email, DeSantis said that he did not knowÂ Jones but that he had been shown an email that she had sent to her supervisor, apologizing.

Meanwhile, the governorâs spokeswoman, Helen Aguirre Ferre, stated in an email to reporters after the conference Jones âexhibited a repeated course of insubordination during her time with the Department, including her unilateral decisions to modify the Departmentâs COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors.â

In a follow-up email, also referenced by DeSantis, Jones told her supervisor that her comments about the employees replacing her had been misconstrued.

âWhat I meant when I said I donât expect the same level of accessibility is that they are busy and canât answer every single email they get right away,â wrote Jones. âIs this one of those stupid things I shouldnât have said?â

During his conference, reporters raised a number of questions for DeSantis to answer. Why was Jones asked to take down data? Why was she taken off the dashboard and later fired? However, the governor left the conference even as the reporters were asking these questions.

10,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-20-new-york-nursing-homes-a-slaughterhouse-for-coronavirus-patients.html,Natural News,2020-05-20,['Michael Alexander'],New York nursing homes now a “slaughterhouse” for elderly coronavirus patients,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Coronavirus-Nursing-Home-Man-Cane.jpg,"(Natural News) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has come under fire for what critics haveÂ called his âawful handlingâ of the COVID-19 pandemic in the stateâs nursing homes.

According to numbers posted by New YorkâsÂ Department of Health, New Yorkâs nursing home COVID-19 death toll stood at 5,601 as of Sunday, a significant chunk of the stateâs total running death toll from the virus.

âThe whole thing has just been handled awfully … by everybody in regard to nursing homes,â said Kathleen Cole, a nurse whose 89-year old mother died after contracting COVID-19 at a nursing home.

âItâs like a slaughterhouse at these places.â

Spike in deaths blamed on Cuomoâs nursing home mandate

This spike in deaths at the stateâs nursing homes, critics said, could be traced back to aÂ mandate that Cuomo put in place back in March that ordered nursing homes to admit recently-released COVID-19 patients without requiring them to undergo further testing.

The policy, similar to those in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and California, was intended to help clear in-demand hospital beds for sicker patients.

Cuomoâs mandate, however, prompted sharp criticism from the nursing home industry, staff members and concerned families, as well as some leading public health experts.

âNursing homes are working so hard to keep the virus out, and now weâre going to be introducing new COVID-positive patients?â David Grabowski, a professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School, said in an interview with NBC.

Cuomo, during his announcement of the said measure, noted that the nursing homes and related facilities cannot object to the new mandate. âThey donât have a right to object. That is the rule and that is the regulation, and they have to comply with that,â Cuomo said.

âThe way this has been handled by the state is totally irresponsible, negligent and stupid,â said Elaine Mazzotta, a nurse whose mother died last month of suspected COVID-19 at a Long Island nursing home. She added that the authorities should not have sent the patients back into the nursing homes. (Related:Â New York begins to reopen as coronavirus cases fall.)

Earlier studies have pointed out that the elderly, as well as others with compromised immune systems, are at greater risk for contracting fatal coronavirus infections.

âTo have a mandate that nursing homes accept COVID-19 patients has put many people in grave danger,â Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York, said in an interview with the Bucks County Courier Times.

âWe know facilities have a lot of infection-control problems, we know that facilities have low staff, so what do you think was going to happen when the staff were further strained in caring for these patients?â Mollot added.

Requirements for nursing home admittance changed

In a press conference, Cuomo noted that the stateâs hospitals are now barred from releasing elderly patients to nursing homes unless the patient tests negative for the virus.

âWeâre just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after a hospital visit. Period,â Cuomo said during the May 10 press conference.

Cuomo also stressed that in the event that a nursing home is deemed âunable to provide proper treatment and supportâ for a recovering resident, that person must then be transferred to the care of the state, which the governor noted as now having ample hospital bed capacity for such patients.

âOur number one priority is protecting people in nursing homes. Itâs where it (COVID-19) feeds,â Cuomo stated.

In addition, Cuomo also announced a step-up in testing for those who work in the stateâs nursing homes, noting that staff at nursing homes will now be required to take two diagnostic tests each week to check for the coronavirus.

Cuomoâs recent pronouncements have been warmly welcomed by industry groups who fiercely opposed the earlier mandate.

âIn order to further protect our residents and staff, we are grateful that hospitals can no longer discharge new patients into nursing homes that have tested positive or were suspected to have COVID-19,â stated Stephen Hanse, president and CEO of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living, which represents long-term care facilities. Hanse noted that Cuomoâs announcement âacknowledgesâ the concerns voiced out by the stateâs nursing homes.

As of reporting time, New York state has logged a total of 352,845 coronavirus infections, as well as 22,182 deaths, according to stateÂ health department data.

Dr. Knut M. Wittkowski, the former head of biostatistics, epidemiology and research design at Rockefeller University, was featured in a video about the virus that was recently posted to YouTube before being quickly removed from YouTube for violating the tech giant’s “community standards.”

The 65-year-old expert in viruses is a vocal critic of so-called “social distancing” and other government-imposed measures that supposedly aim to fight the pandemic. He has repeatedly warned that such measures are not helping but rather prolonging the crisis â and for this he is no longer welcome on YouTube.

About the time that a video of Dr. Wittkowski explaining all of this reached about 1.3 million views, YouTube pulled it down and banned it, just like it has done to many other videos and channels over the years.

In Dr. Wittkowski’s view â and keep in mind that the guy holds two doctorates, one in computer science and the other in medical biometry â the best response to the Wuhan coronavirus is to basically let it do its thing. Most people will not even develop symptoms, and thus will never even know they have it. The small percentage of people who do get sick will also largely recover, while those with the highest risk can simply stay at home until the worst of it has ended, if they so choose.

“With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity,” he stated in the now-deleted video. “About 80 percent of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won’t even have recognized that they were infected.”

You will not encounter this type of censorship at Brighteon.com, by the way, which is hosting the Plandemic film that has also been deleted and banned by YouTube.

As usual, YouTube provided no explanation as to why Dr. Wittkowski’s video was removed

In speaking to the New York Post about his video’s removal, Dr. Wittkowski was perplexed, to say the least. He said that all he did was share with viewers his understanding as to how viruses work while presenting an alternative approach to dealing with this current pandemic, which apparently is not allowed.

“I was just explaining what we had,” he stated. “They don’t tell you why. They just say it violates our community standards. There’s no explanation for what those standards are or what standards it violated.”

Another possible reason that Dr. Wittkowski got the axe from YouTube is because he has likened the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to a “bad flu,” an opinion that YouTube and other tech giants have stated in the past “is problematic.” Everyone is apparently expected to believe that this crisis is the worst thing to strike the world since the Holocaust, and all must respond with cowering trepidation to the government’s demands.

“Anything that goes against [World Health Organization] recommendations would be a violation of our policy and so removal is another really important part of our policy,” admitted YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki during a recent interview with CNN.

While Dr. Wittkowski’s viewpoints may not be in the majority, they do align with what has been implemented in Sweden, where “social distancing” and societal shutdowns were never implemented.

Facebook is also going after people and groups that it deems as spreading “dangerous” information. The company has reportedly been working with state governments in California, Nebraska and New Jersey to remove event pages for anti-lockdown gatherings.

The Chinese Communist Party,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/America-and-Communism.jpg,"(Natural News) Has the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) won? It would seem as though America’s response to the pandemic has been far worse than the virus itself with politicians racing to see who can trash the Constitution the fastest, plunging our once great nation into the same totalitarian paradigm as communist China.

While China was the first to impose extreme draconian measures to supposedly reign in the novel virus, the United States has been more than happy to carry the torch of authoritarianism much further than many probably anticipated, setting a chilling precedent as the rest of the world looks on in horror.

What was once thought to only occur only in dictatorships has quickly spread around the world in the name of keeping people “safe.” And perhaps no group is prouder about what has been accomplished than the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which we now know is orders of magnitude more threatening than any virus.

Human rights activist Chen Guangcheng said it right when he recently called on the world to “come together to confront the CCP,” contending that it “is the biggest and most serious virus of all.”

Speaking with William Saunders on Faith and Law’s Friday Forum, Chen emphasized that the time is now for the world to recognize “the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to all humanity.” And now that many of the CCP’s doctrines are manifesting here in the West right before our very eyes, his statements ring truer than ever with each passing day.

In China, dissidents are not allowed to express their opinions vocally, for fear that they might be arrested or worse. Peaceful protest is largely a no-no in China, and thanks to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) it is also becoming a no-no in some places here in the states, particularly in leftist enclaves where governors are telling people that they cannot gather to speak out because that breaks “social distancing” guidelines.

China also does not like human reproduction and has put extreme measures in place to restrict people from having babies. Well, the same thing is now happening here in the United States as some doctors are reportedly chastising their patients who wish to get pregnant, warning them that doing so is not acceptable due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Coronavirus is also a virus of the mind

In many ways, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a virus both of the body and of the mind because the fear it is generating among some is fueling a type of hatred against the freedoms and liberties this country has long cherished. Suddenly it is no longer acceptable to go to church or to spend time in nature, at least not without everyone wearing masks and being six feet apart at all times.

The types of things that freedom-minded folks used to only hear about taking place in some faraway land are suddenly becoming commonplace here in America, in other words. A mass surveillance police state the likes of which communist China only could have dreamed about implementing here in the U.S. is now being welcomed and even demanded by many of our own citizens thanks to fear and paranoia about the pandemic.

Oh, come on, many of them argue, it will not last forever! Except that it will if history is any indicator. As it turns out, those who become drunk on power tend not to give it back, in this case defying the rights of the American people that, sadly, are no longer unified in a common understanding of what those rights even entail.

“No matter how nice the free world tries to be, dictators will not change,” Guangcheng warns about how authoritarians need to be treated. “The reality you have to face is that dictators see you as the enemy. And it’s not only the people directly ruled by dictators who face harm, as you now see from the coronavirus.”

13,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-20-chinese-startup-develops-smart-glasses-check-for-coronavirus.html,Natural News,2020-05-20,['Franz Walker'],Chinese startup develops smart glasses to check for coronavirus symptoms… but do they work?,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/screen-smart-glasses-futuristic-high-tech.jpg,"(Natural News) To help efforts to screen for symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, a Chinese startup has developed augmented reality glasses that lets wearers âseeâ a person’s temperature. Developed byÂ a company called Rokid, the T1 smart glasses use a frame-mounted thermal camera to measure people’s temperatures from a distance, even while they’re moving.

“Apart from fixed temperature measurement, T1 can provide portable, distant and prompt temperature checking, which would be a great help,” Rokid vice president Xiang Wenjie said.

Xiang claims that the company developed its T1 glasses in only two weeks. He says that the company has already sold about 1,000 pairs of glasses to governments, industrial parks and schools.

Augmented reality to show people’s temperatures

Augmented reality technology uses special glasses to allowÂ informationÂ to be overlayed over what a person sees, providing them with more data on what they’re looking at. In the case of Rokid’s T1, the glasses use anÂ infrared sensor on a 12-megapixel camera that the company claims can detect the temperatures of up to 200 people within two minutes, from as far as three meters away.

Computing power for the glasses comes from a Qualcomm CPU, which also allows it to offer other features such as hands-free voice controls as well as the live recording of photos and video.

The Chinese startup plansÂ business-to-business (B2B) sales of the wearable device in America, sayingÂ that the T1 can assist businesses, hospitals and law enforcement with COVID-19 detection.Â ItÂ claims that it is already working on deals with several U.S. hospitals and local municipalities to deliver shipments of the T1 thermal imaging wearables. However, they couldn’t name any due to confidentiality agreements.

One company that is looking into Rokid’s glasses is California basedÂ online grocerÂ Weee! The e-commerce company confirmed to TechCrunchÂ that it isÂ evaluating the T1 glasses to monitor the temperatures of its warehouse employees throughout the day.

As for procedures to manage those who the glasses detect as having COVID-19 related symptoms — such as referring them for testing — Rokid’s U.S. director Liang Guan says that this is something for their clients to determine on their own.

âThe clients can do the follow-up action, such as giving them a mask or asking to work from home,â said Guan.

The T1 glasses can connect to computers via USB and can also be set up for âinternet of thingsâ (IoT) capabilities, allowing commercial clients to connect them to their own platforms.

Privacy concerns with smart glasses

As novel as the idea of smart glasses that measure people’s temperatures may be, the device could catch the attention of U.S. regulators, who have become much warier of Chinese tech firms handling of American citizen’s data.

For its part, Rokid claims that it doesn’t collect data from the glasses directly.

âRegarding this moduleâ¦we do not take any data to the cloud. For customers, privacy is very important to them. The data measurement is stored locally,â explained Guan.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), temperature checks are counted as medical exams, something that employers normally cannot mandate their employees to undergo.Â With the COVID-19 outbreak now classified as a pandemic, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has issued guidance allowing employers toÂ ask their employees to have their temperatures checked. However,Â employees’ temperature data is still covered by the ADA’s confidentiality requirements. (Related.Â The coronavirus outbreak is sparking the rollout of more digital surveillance.)

Should U.S. companies come to adopt Rokid’s T1 smart glasses, they’ll need to make sure that they adhere to these rules, and that the glasses and whatever systems they connect to them, protect the data that they harvest.

It’s the perfect globalist enslavement system: You stay home and stay off the streets, they skim money from the money-printing Federal Reserve, then they mail you big fat bailout checks along with vote-by-mail ballots so you keep electing them to send you more money while you’re slowly bled to death with currency debasement and medical police state surveillance.

What more could a globalist hope for?

That’s why it’s crucial that We the People beat this virus before the globalists finish us off.

And the only way to do that is to get real about the threat of this very real, laboratory-concocted biological weapon system that has been deployed against humanity. Dr. Judy Mikovits agrees on this point, by the way, that the coronavirus went through a laboratory and is a very real, very dangerous pathogen that’s transmitted from person to person (see video below). And that makes it dangerous. All the more reason to get informed and learn how to beat this thing before we all end up starved to death and vaccinated like cattle with “kill switch” euthanasia jabs that are about to be rolled out across America.

Yes, you are the lab rat for Big Pharma’s insane medical experiments, didn’t you know? And you can’t protest as long as you’re locked down. You can’t even criticize the vaccine depopulation agenda because you’ll be censored by Big Tech and the communist Chinese who now control Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Your only function from here forward, from the point of view of the globalists, is to die as quickly as possible so they don’t have to deal with you anymore.

Because the globalists are literally at war with humanity, and your very existence is an affront to their agenda of depopulation and mass genocide against humanity.

Sadly, far too many people still remain in a state of denialism about the existence of the virus and how it has been deployed as a weapon against humanity. Denialism isn’t a strategy for a pro-human victory against this virus. Those who claim the virus doesn’t exist or is “just the flu” are hurting humanity’s ability to fight back. They’re actually compromising human freedom by interfering with our grassroots response to defeat this globalist bioweapon before the death science engineers kill us all with their gain-of-function weapons that are specifically designed to target human tissue.

So here are ten basic facts that I urge us all to keep in mind as we end the lockdowns and reopen our economies. If we forget these ten facts, we will pay a very steep price for complacency. We may, in fact, not survive the globalist plans for mass extermination.

Defeat the virus and you defeat the globalists. They were almost defeated already, which is why they released this “nuclear option” bioweapon in desperation, by the way. It’s their last play, and if we defeat this virus, we can finally move against the globalists and “hang them in the streets,” so to speak, for their crimes against us all.

Basic Fact #1) The Wuhan coronavirus was developed in a lab.Â This virus was engineered with gain-of-function properties to target human tissue and spread from person to person in “stealth” mode (asymptomatic carriers). That’s why it’s the most dangerous global pathogen we’ve ever faced — because it wasÂ engineered to kill human beings. No, this is no “natural” virus from bats. What a joke.

Basic Fact #2) The Wuhan coronavirus was released in China, then spread across the globe. Never forget that this was released in China but could not be contained there. It spread so effectively that it encircled the globe almost overnight, even with efforts to block air traffic and close borders. None of those efforts worked, and the virus exploded worldwide anyway. This virus was never “contained” and will never be contained by any incompetent government. It will continue to spread as the lockdowns are lifted.

Basic Fact #3) The Wuhan coronavirus is transmitted from person to person. It spreads from the lungs of one person to the lungs of another person. Hence the wisdom in wearing masks in shared indoor environments or public transportation. This also explains why its unmitigated infection rate is exponential, not linear. And it has just barely begun to infect a small percentage of the total human population. (There’s much more excitement yet to come…)

Basic Fact #4) People who don’t know they are infected and show no symptoms can spread it to others (asymptomatic carriers). This is the “stealth mode” that makes this virus so dangerous. People spread it even before they know they have it, and they can bypass simple measures (such as temperature checkpoints) with ease.

Basic Fact #5) The Wuhan coronavirus is orders of magnitude more deadly than the regular flu. The regular flu only kills about 1 in 4,000 who are infected (Infection Fatality Rate), or about 1 in 1,000 who are diagnosed and symptomatic (Case Fatality Rate). Yet the Case Fatality Rate for the Wuhan coronavirus looks to be about 10% so far, based on current numbers being reported around the world. That makes it about 100 times more deadly than the regular flu. (No, this ain’t the flu, bro.)

Basic Fact #6) The Wuhan coronavirus mutates rapidly and can mutate to express affinity for different receptors in the human body. This means it can morph into a whole new form that nullifies all existing immunity or whatever vaccines might be working at the time. Literally overnight, this virus can render all vaccines obsolete, and it can reset every human being on planet Earth back to the “uninfected” status based on its receptor site mutations. Imagine going through two years of the ACE2 version of the coronavirus only to find out it then mutates to a whole new receptor and we get to start all over. That’s not science fiction… it’s a very likely outcome.

Basic Fact #7) Because of the rapid mutation rate, a vaccine may never be developed that works against the Wuhan coronavirus. This is a fundamental science fact, and it probably explains why the CEO of Moderna — the vaccine company touted by Trump as offering a miracle treatment for the pandemic — is selling his own stock shares like mad instead of buying them up like mad. If he thought the vaccine was going to be a huge success, he’s be buying, not selling stock. Does he already know the vaccine will fail? That’s what it looks like.

Basic Fact #8) COVID-19 is not an acute respiratory disease but rather a blood clotting / coagulation and inflammation disease, and ventilators are killing patients. This means the “standard of care” offered in most hospitals is actually a death sentence, which is why 88% of people who are put on ventilators end up dead. It also means the fatality numbers for coronavirus didn’t have to be as large as they are now, since many people were actually killed by ventilators when they really needed oxygen.

Basic Fact #9) Nutrition plays a key role in preventing coronavirus infections and transmission. We now know that those who have excellent nutrition (vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, anti-inflammatory foods, etc.) almost never get killed by the coronavirus. We also know that natural treatments like chlorine dioxide have so far been shown to have a near-100 percent cure rate. But of course, anything that really works will be banned or criminalized because our world is controlled by a criminal drug cartel known as Big Pharma and the FDA. (The Food and DEATH Administration.)

Basic Fact #10) The only reason the number of hospitalizations and deaths is now falling in America is because the social distancing lockdowns worked. Without the lockdowns, the numbers would still be following an exponential expansion curve, and we would right now be witnessing perhaps 30,000 deaths per day in the United States. Thankfully, we’re really seeing something much closer to 1,000 deaths per day, down from about 2,800 per day. That achievement is largely due to the lockdowns.

In that realization is a stern warning for our shared future: If we end the lockdowns and pretend this virus is history, it will come back and bite us with a vengeance. Complacency will lead to catastrophe, which is why we must not become complacent as we work toward restoring more “normalcy” across society.

Denialism is a losing strategy, but facing this virus armed with facts and nutrition and real science, we can defeat it and move to defeat those who built it.

Join the pro-human resistance against the death science globalists who are trying to exterminate us all

It’s time for humanity to rise up around the planet and declare war on those governments, institutions and corporations that are deliberately working to exterminate us. It’s time for humanity to invoke its right to global self-defense and stop the atrocities being carried out against us by virologists, genetic engineers and vaccine Nazis. We either take a stand and fight for survival or we get exterminated in the next 1-2 years with wave after wave of deadly vaccines and depopulation bioweapons that will be released right on schedule.

You think Fauci’s knowledge of a “second wave” is just a lucky guess? Nope, he’s in on it. He knows the second wave is coming because he helped fund the second wave of bioweapons that are being readied for release right now.

You think the lockdowns will be over soon? Not a chance. They’ll have you under house arrest yet again before this year is finished, shivering with fright from a second round of bioweapons and engineered vaccines that actually spread the pandemic even faster.

If you want to live much longer, it turns out you’re going to have to earn the right to live by fighting against those who are trying to kill you. And you can’t do that sitting at home collecting an unemployment check and voting by mail to elect the next round of complicit, corrupt criminals who are all bought off by Big Pharma death cultists. At some point, you’re either going to have to get off your ass and join the pro-human uprising or surrender to the vaccine euthanasia shots and die on your knees as a subservient vaccine slave.

After hitting record highs in early April, the number of claimants has declined steadily over the past six weeks, but the total number of people claiming unemployment as a result of the coronavirus pandemic is still disturbingly high at 36.5 million.

Experts warn that this number will continue to increase in the coming weeks.

The American economy is bleeding, and people are desperate for relief, which is one of the main reasons for the nationwide waning of support for the strict lockdown measures that scientists insist need to be eased with great care to prevent a second â potentially more deadly â wave of COVID-19 infections.

While economists and healthcare officials continue to present conflicting views about what is best for the country, the reality on the ground is that people canât make their mortgage payments, and some can no longer afford to feed their families.

President Trump has already signed the largest rescue package in U.S. history, known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, into law.

Now, the House has approved a proposal for a further $3 trillion in aid.

The Republican-controlled Senate has indicated that it will not approve the Houseâs so-called HEROES Act, but the White House has indicated that it would support handing out another round of stimulus checks. (Related:Â Coronavirus pushes unemployment to highest levels since the Great Depression.)

The largest bailout in U.S. history

As reported by Smart Asset, Democrats and Republicans were uncharacteristically cooperative in their efforts to get the initial $2 trillion CARES Act passed.

That legislation made provision for emergency financial assistance to individuals and businesses in distress as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

A further $484 billion in funding was later approved by the president to assist small business programs and healthcare providers. (Related:Â Massive fraud alert: Coronavirus ârecoveryâ bill gives Fed control over $450 billion in SECRET â whoâs going to get this money?)

The first round of stimulus checks were provided for those who submitted income tax returns in 2018 or 2019 (whichever was the most recent), and paid out $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples, in addition to $500 for dependents. The checks were payable to individuals who earned upwards of $75,000 and couples whose earnings totaled less than $150,000 annually. The amounts payable were reduced on a sliding scale for those in higher income brackets.

The HEROES Act would provide yet another $3 trillion in relief funding, as reported by VOX:

The legislation, which includes over $900 billion in federal funding for states and cities, as well as another round of stimulus checks and an extension for expanded unemployment insurance, passed the House 208-199 predominately on party lines. â¦

Democrats note theyâve moved quickly on this measure due to the urgency of the crisis. The bill, which also contains a $200 billion fund to cover hazard pay for frontline workers, is Democratsâ stake in the ground as negotiations continue.

While Senate Republicans have not expressed much interest in the bill, senior White House officials have indicated that the president would support the distribution of further stimulus checks.

As reported by CNBC, a statement from the White House added:

As President Trump has said, we are going to ensure that we take care of all Americans so that we emerge from this challenge healthy, stronger, and with economic prosperity, which is why the White House is focused on pro-growth, middle class tax and regulatory relief.

Clearly, the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the U.S. economy, and Americans are in dire need of assistance, but are these massive bailouts really the answer? Should the government be more focused on ways to provide long-term economic relief to the millions of Americans affected by the pandemic rather than handing them a check to tide them over for another month?

According to reports, male coronavirus patients in Long Island, New York, are being given high doses of estrogen based on a “hunch” by some doctors that turning men into women could be the solution to this deadly pandemic.

Unbelievably, there are at least two clinical trials currently underway that involve dosing otherwise healthy men with female hormones, which some doctors claim could help to improve their immunity. Physicians in Los Angeles are also conducting similar experiments using progesterone, a prominent female hormone, which they contend could provide anti-inflammatory benefits.

“There’s a striking difference between the number of men and women in the intensive care unit, and men are clearly doing worse,” says Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care physician at Cedars-Sinai who is heading up the West Coast progesterone study.

According to Ghandehari, 75 percent of her hospital’s ICU patients on ventilators are men, so this must mean that being male makes a person more at risk of suffering from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), in her view.

On the other hand, women, including pregnant women who are immunocompromised, lean towards suffering milder bouts of coronavirus-induced disease. So this is more “proof” to Ghandehari that emasculating men by screwing up their hormones is the only way forward in fighting this pandemic.

“So something about being a woman is protective, and something about pregnancy is protective, and that makes us think about hormones,” Ghandehari is further quoted as saying, presenting her opinions as “science.”

Deep state “medicine” will claim any excuse to target masculinity for elimination

That someone supposedly schooled in the healing arts would so quickly jump to targeting male hormones as some type of “cure” for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) just goes to show how deeply the anti-male agenda has embedded itself into society.

The system is no longer even pretending to seek sound scientific solutions to public health threats like this, instead turning every opportunity for honest investigation into a political agenda, in this case female empowerment.

The old adage that correlation does not equal causation immediately goes out the window anytime there is an opportunity to prop up women at the expense of men. After all, this entire arm of experimental coronavirus research hinges upon the notion that men are inherently “flawed” and have to have their natural male hormones replaced with female hormones in order to stay “healthy.”

It is undeniable that men require healthy levels of testosterone and other male hormones in order to live their best lives. And to deprive men of male hormones massively increases their risk of death from a variety of causes.

But Ghandehari and her colleagues are apparently more concerned with seizing this opportunity to target men while claiming that their motives are to advance “science.” Just who do they think that they are fooling?

Another woman, Dr. Sharon Nachman from the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island, is pulling a similar fast one on men living on the East Coast, as she, too, is convinced that being male is the problem when it comes to catching the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“It’s totally out of the box,” Nachman is quoted as stating proudly, adding that this “is how good ideas often start.”

Brian Kemp releases rigged coronavirus chart that scrambles dates to create false impression of infection decline,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Stupid-Dumb-Man-Eyes.jpg,"(Natural News) STUPID-19 is a disease that makes people lose their minds when they try to deny the existence of the coronavirus pandemic. Today, STUPID-19 has struck the Governor of Georgia.

In what must be the most outrageous example of data fakery and government fraud we’ve seen yet, the Republican Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has been caught red-handed releasing a misleading coronavirus infection trend chart that “scrambled” dates to create the false impression of a steady decline in coronavirus infections.

The graph, shown below, was released by the Georgia Department of Health and covers Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, Gwinnet and Hall counties, appearing to show a steadily declining infection trend for all five counties over time.

But it turns out the x-axis of the chart used “scrambled” dates that were obviously hand-picked to create the false appearance of a downward trend over time. Normally, a chart that presents an x-axis of time would use sequential segments of time, not scrambled days or months that are picked solely to produce an apparent visual trend. But if you look closely at the x-axis below, you’ll see the chart begins with April 28th, then goes to April 27th, April 29th, May 1st, April 30th, May 6th, May 4th, etc.

In other words, Georgia scrambled the x-axis, choosing data from dates that would create a visual downward trend, even as the state claimed the chart showed data “over the last 15 days.” Technically it did, but not 15 sequential days.

Chronology be damned. Georgia wants to “prove” the coronavirus is no big deal, and they’re willing to travel back and forth through time, if necessary, to reinforce that point.

Here’s the big picture of the chart, which claims to present data “over the past 15 days and the number of cases over time.” (I guess technically they didn’t promise the “time” would be sequential…)

And here’s a zoomed-in version showing you some of the dates along the x-axis:

Notice how the dates are all scrambled, sort of like Brian Kemp’s STUPID-19 brain.

We give Kemp one thumbs up for effort, but another thumb up his ass for stupidity. Only in a Republican-led denialism state where numbers, math and charts are apparently befuddling to the guy in charge would we end up with this hilariously lame attempt at public deception.

Oh, and the Governor’s communications director, Candice Broce (@Candicebroce) must have undergone a frontal lobotomy before posting this indecipherable explanation on Twitter that tries to justify the obvious fraud. See if you can make any sense of this:

“The x axis was set up that way to show descending values to more easily demonstrate peak values and counties on those dates. Our mission failed. We apologize. It is fixed.”

This graphic has been the subject of much head scratching by the @AJCInteractives team today. https://t.co/FS69vasFxR — Pete Corson (@petecorson) May 10, 2020

Wait, whah? “To more easily demonstrate peak values and counties on those dates?”

Oh dear God, please tell me these aren’t the people in charge of the great State of Georgia.

I mean, with numbers and dates and colored bars and math and sh#t, sure it can all get confusing when you’re suffering from STUPID-19, but as my way of offering public assistance to the brain-dead leaders of Georgia, might I suggest counting on your fingers and toes, which will at least get you to 20 unless you’ve had a horrible barefoot mowing accident of some kind.

And if you can count to 20 without getting confused, heck, you should run for Governor and try to displace the current governor who can’t seem to count to 15 (days).

Kinda makes you wonder how these people are supposed to lead an “economy recovery,” doesn’t it? Maybe the economy of Georgia will achieve a sharp upward trend but only if you rearrange the dates in just the right way…

18,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-19-trump-coronavirus-vaccine-will-not-be-mandatory.html,Natural News,2020-05-19,['Mike Adams'],"Trump affirms coronavirus vaccine will NOT be mandatory at the federal level, but governors might force vaccinations at the state level",https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Coronavirus-Trump-Briefing-Covid-19.jpg,"(Natural News) President Trump has confirmed that, from a federal perspective, coronavirus vaccines will not be forced upon people who don’t want them. In statements made last Friday, he said that, “Not everyone is going to want to get it” and that the vaccine would only be for those who do want it, reports LifeSiteNews.

This is relief, for now, as Trump had previously announced he was going to mobilize the military to distribute and administer the vaccine. Using the military to administer vaccines sounds like coercion would be involved at some point, since there’s no shortage of civilians in America who can and will administer vaccines (pharmacists, nurses, doctors, etc.) without needing any help from armed soldiers.

Governors may still require mandatory vaccines at the state level

Even if Trump does not push for mandatory vaccines at the federal level, governors may require vaccines at the state level. And this means America will likely be divided into “vaccine SLAVE states” vs. “anti-vaccine FREE states.”

In the vaccine slave states, your body is owned by the state which can demand you submit to an unlimited number of forced injections, no matter how risky or dangerous the vaccine might be. (Operation Warp Speed guarantees that vaccines will be released while still in the experimental phase, transforming Americans into human guinea pigs for Big Pharma’s mad medical experiments.)

In the anti-vaccine free states, governors will respect the individual decisions of citizens who are recognized as the rightful owners of their own bodies. Anti-vaccine free states will likely be states that lean more conservatives, while vaccine slave states will of course be the states run by Democrats and progressives.

This means that citizens who live in “progressive” states like California and New York are about to experience the full meaning of “progressivism,” which essentially requires you to surrender your individual freedoms, liberties and even your body to the whims of the corrupt state. In centuries long ago, kings asserted their “divine right” to rape anyone they chose, and today, Democrat governors will assert the same right to medically rape anyone living under their jurisdiction.

Because forced vaccines are medical rape.

Employers might require coronavirus vaccines for all employees

In the same way that Democrat-run states may demand mandatory (forced) vaccinations of everyone, employers might also demand that all their employees be vaccinated, even against their will. We’ve already seen examples of this type of coercion in the medical field, where doctors and nurses who have refused to be vaccinated against the flu, for example, are fired and denied employment.

It’s not difficult to imagine this also being applied to daycare workers, school teachers, food industry workers and other sectors of the economy. Employers are likely to demand vaccines for everyone as a way to reduce their own perceived liability in case they are sued by another worker who contracts the coronavirus while at work. Corporations need to be able to say, “We did everything possible to prevent infections,” including issuing vaccine mandates for all their employees.

Thus, just because President Trump isn’t pushing vaccine mandates (at the moment), it doesn’t mean your governor, or state health department or employer won’t try to jab you against your will.

Mandatory vaccines, of course, are medical rape. They violate your body against your consent, injecting you with foreign substances that may cause injury or death. We can fully expect California’s Gov. Newsom to come out as a medical rapist who demands the power to violate the body of every man, woman and child living in the State of California.

As these medical rape programs are rolled out, we fully expect to see people fleeing the vaccine slave states and escaping to free states where they can say no to toxic, experimental vaccines that contain dangerous, unproven ingredients. Those who stay behind and try to survive the vaccine mandates will, of course, likely find themselves infertile or dead within a year or two. Depopulation has been the plan from the very beginning. And tyranny. What an amazing coincidence that the biological weapons release, the extended lockdowns and the mandatory vaccines just happen to accomplish all the globalists’ top goals, all at once.

What can we do?,https://naturalnewsblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cancer-Cell-Attack-Body-Virus-Bacteria.jpg,"It is incredible, to say the least, everything that is happening worldwide. Undoubtedly it is hard to believe that this is even real. Sometimes I think we are in a bad dream hoping to wake up soon. As a mother, the first thing that comes to mind is my family’s safety. Understanding and implementing every precaution possible to protect my children is my top priority. Of course, due to my personal journey and now as a wellness blogger and health advocate I can’t help to wonder how much of impact this COVID-19 disease may have on cancer patients.

We already know that cancer patients are immune-compromised, to begin with. Therefore, cancer patients automatically fall in the higher risk category. But what about those that are in the treatment and those that are in remission? According to a small study conducted in Wuhan, China, “Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection,” the study, which was recently published in the Annals of Oncology, states. “It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.”

Furthermore, researchers found “more than half (53.6%) of the patients involved in the study developed severe events—defined by admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, or death—with 28.6% of the patients dying. This is far higher than the general COVID-19-infected population, which has an average clinically critical status rate of 4.7%, and a mortality rate of 2.3%.”

Researchers also wrote, “Patients with lung cancer, with worse baseline lung function and endurance, are more likely to develop more severe anoxia and progress more rapidly with COVID-19”

I’m not a researcher but my common sense tells me that the conclusion found on this small study conducted ironically enough in Wuhan China makes a lot of sense. Of course, the outcome for cancer patients would be poor and more challenging if dealing with the COVID-19 in addition to cancer. This is why it is vital for patients to be proactive in their current treatment plan and implement a preventive plan not only to get tested but discuss with their medical/ oncology team the possibilities before continuing with immunosuppressing treatments, making themselves more vulnerable to COVID-19.

What Can We Do?

In one of my most recent blog articles titled “How to fight the Coronavirus naturally” I share additional helpful tips to help you boost your immunity and take additional precautions as a preventive mechanism for you to be safe during this crisis. Let me provide you with a quick summary:

Practice the following to prevent and protect from the virus:

• Social distancing (2 meters minimum) because the secretions that are the ones that contaminate cannot move more than 2 meters due to the weight of the virus.

• Correct handwashing, for 20 seconds (both surfaces, anterior-posterior, interfaces, and fingertips) each time you come from outside or enter or leave any public space.

• Use of masks when traveling through crowded areas (supermarkets, banks, hospitals, etc.)

• Clean surfaces with disinfectant (especially those that may be in common and frequent contact)

Boost your Immune System

Keeping our immunity strong is most definitely the best form of prevention and our strongest defense when facing any sort of illness that threatens our lives. Here are some powerful and amazing tips to help you boost your immunity:

Take a good Probiotic

Take Vitamin D3

Vitamin C IV therapy

Take Camu Camu Powder

Take Beta Glucan

Eat Adaptogens like Maca

Follow a Plant-based Diet

Mild Exercise

Rebound

Infrared Sauna

Chiropractic Care

Colloidal Silver

Water

According to the most recently published article by JAMA (An International peer-reviewed medical journal association), the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that results from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Furthermore, the article shares that following initial reports of disease outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with cases identified in at least 67 countries across 6 continents. So if this is an acute respiratory illness why is the world-wide population running out of toilet paper? Ok, I must admit this is funny but not really!

What is coronavirus disease 2019?

According to the CDC, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China. It spreads from person to person and the risk of infection lies if you are in close contact with someone that has it. As of March 27th, 2020, the CDC has reported 68,440 total cases nationwide. Travel-related cases 636, close contact related 1,074, and under investigation 66,730 cases.

What are the Symptoms?

It looks like the symptoms are similar to a cold or the flu, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Can a Virus be killed?

This is could totally fall under a trick question category. I’ve gotten different feedback from my circle of doctors and honestly after many physician surveys and personal research, it is my opinion that the answer to this tricky question is NO. Viruses can’t function without interacting with a living cell. On their own, they’re also essentially inert — unable to move. According to The National Human Genome Research Institute, “A virus is an infectious agent that occupies a place near the boundary between the living and the nonliving. It is a particle much smaller than a bacterial cell, consisting of a small genome of either DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat. Viruses enter host cells and hijack the enzymes and materials of the host cells to make more copies of themselves. Viruses cause a wide variety of diseases in plants and animals, including AIDS, measles, smallpox, and polio.” In order for viruses to thrive and live these must find a host. This article further explains a virus is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the cells of another organism. Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. Viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products. In other words, once a virus finds a host, the host and virus go into war and let the stronger one win.

Is there a Vaccine or Treatment for the Coronavirus?

NOPE! There is no vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19. The best cure is prevention! Below I share my preventive tips for you and your loved ones to follow as preventive means to this worldwide threat.

The Fear Factor

It is amazing to me to see how our human nature so easily gravitates to fear mode and we are easily triggered to respond from a place of fear versus reasoning or just common sense. Although there’s much evidence that indicates that fear suppresses our immunity somehow social panic continues to prevail in the face of this so-called worldwide threat. Keep in mind that we are modeling to our children how to react in the face of challenging circumstances. Perhaps behind the scenes of this pandemic virus hides the acts of cleverly masked and highly manipulative private organizations, selective groups and why not even governments. I guess there is no way to know for sure but what we do know for sure is that through technology and social media we can get up-to-date worldwide news and respond quickly to life-altering events such as the Coronavirus outbreak.

How can We Protect Ourselves?

As I have said there’s no magic bullet to fight off this COVID-19 virus. A study published by The Journal of Hospital Infection found that the virus can linger on surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. However, it can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures. The most important line of defense you and I have against it is to be proactive to follow some specific precautions and most definitely boost our immune system. Here are some steps to implement and follow immediately:

Avoid exposure (stay home / avoid crowded places)

Keep social distance

Wash hands often with soap for at least 20 seconds

Disinfect surfaces with household cleaning products

Use disposable utensils

Do not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth

Cover your cough and sneeze

Avoid contact with sick people

Stay home and wear a mask if you are sick

Make children feel safe and share facts with them

Empathy is key

Try to maintain a normal routine

Model the behavior you want to see

Take care of yourself by boosting your immunity

How can I Boost my Immune System?

A healthy immune system is key to protect ourselves from ALL kinds of diseases. Keeping our immunity strong is most definitely the best form of prevention and our strongest defense when facing any sort of illness that threatens our lives. Boosting our immune system is a great way to keep us healthy and ready in the face of something like the COVID-19. Here are some powerful and amazing tips to help you boost your immunity:

Take a good Probiotic

As you probably know, your immune system begins in the gut. Did you know that 80% of your immune system is in your gut? Gut health has overwhelmingly been linked to the health of your immune system. Because of the foods we eat, and the chemicals in our environment,

no matter how hard we work to create toxin-free homes, the good bacteria in the gut of the average modern person is overwhelmingly low. A good source of probiotics can cause that community of good bacteria to flourish in your gut, providing continual nourishment of the immune system.

The Power of Beta 1,3D Glucan

Beta-Glucans are one of the greatest weapons ever introduced to the immune system. Beta 1,3D Glucan helps reduce free radicals, can act as an antioxidant, and it’s effective in supporting the immune system by:

Helps naturally modulate a healthy immune system

Helps reduce free radicals and can act like an antioxidant

Effective in supporting the immune system: Increases t-cell production Enhances macrophages Enhances natural killer cell functionality



Vitamin D3 a must-have

Vitamin D supplementation has been proven to assist with immune system health. A lack of vitamin D is associated with a multitude of health problems: cancer, auto-immune disease, osteoporosis, and multiple infectious diseases, just to name a few. Researchers have found that Vitamin D:

Regulates the enzymes in your brain that help with nerve growth, neurotransmitter production, and synaptic density. These are all things that are essential for brain health.

It helps maintain intracellular calcium and phosphorus levels.

Protects your nervous tissue from oxidative stress.

It helps control your immune system response.

And more.

Camu Camu as your natural source of Vitamin C

This Peruvian berry is found in the wilderness of the Amazon rainforest. Camu Camu contains more immune-boosting and inflammation-fighting Vitamin C than any other food. In powdered form, just one single teaspoonful of the powerful berry contains 1200% of your daily recommended minimum Vitamin C!

The Immune Benefits of MACA

Also, known as a powerful adaptogen, this Peruvian superfood is a well-known immune booster for its ability to increase glutathione production known to improve immune function and cause disease resistance. Maca is a cruciferous vegetable and therefore related to broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and kale. It has a long history of medicinal use in Peru.

Exercise

When you exercise, the number of white blood cells can increase, which increases your disease-fighting arsenal. It has also been suggested that any exercise that increases your breathing and heart-rate can flush toxins out of your lungs, making it more difficult for cold and flu to take hold, and less likely that a secondary infection will develop from viruses.

Infrared Sauna

I am so blessed to have one at home, as this therapy can help you not only to detoxify the body and stimulate your immune system and immune response, but it is also known to get rid of bacteria and viruses.
