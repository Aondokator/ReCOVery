The World Bank warns that there is a global poverty increase as tens of millions of people have fallen back into poverty because of the pandemic. Up to 60 million people worldwide may fall into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus, said David Malpass, head of the World Bank.

“Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty, erasing all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years, and our forecasts indicate a deep recession,” Malpass said on Tuesday.

According to him, the bank is trying to help people by providing loans in 100 countries and pledged to provide $160 billion in loans up to mid-2021. Malpass did add that these efforts were not enough. He called on creditor countries to join the G20 initiative – a ban on debt repayment for some developing countries.

The most severe challenges are developing countries. It has been predicted that in Africa tens of millions of people will earn less than the minimum income, that is, below the poverty line. But in many ways, the function of these forecasts is that they show what will happen if we do nothing. It will be difficult to prevent the development of this scenario, but with the joint efforts and cooperation of the whole world, there are legitimate grounds to prevent the most negative consequences.

However, we imagine that poverty only increases in the developing world. Morgan Stanley investment bank found that the global economy will only return to pre-crisis state in the third quarter of 2021. Deutsche Bank even launched more pessimistic forecasts – by the end of next year, developed countries’ GDP will be $1 trillion lower than 2019.

The World Trade Organization has warned that international trade will experience the deepest recession since World War II. The International Monetary Fund on April 14 said the total damage will be greater than the bank’s assessment. As stated by IMF chief economist Gita Gopinat, we are talking about $9 trillion dollars. According to the IMF, by the end of 2020, the global economy will lose 3%. This is a significant amount considering that during the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, the downturn was 0.08%.

This has exposed that the liberal global economic order is extremely vulnerable. The U.S. economy will fall by 5.9%, firstly by a quarterly sharp decline. Based on JPMorgan’s forecast, this index will reach 40%. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg believe Europe will lose 8.3% of its GDP in the next few months. In total, from January to July, this figure will reach 10% and by the end of the year will be 5.2%. Italy and Spain will suffer the most, with GDP declines of 7.3% and 5.7%, respectively.

Pre-coronavirus data found that in the U.S. 16.2% of children lived in poverty, that is almost 1 in 6 children, with 2.5 million children experiencing homelessness in 2015. 29.9% of Americans live close to poverty while 5.3% of the population live in deep poverty. In addition, in 2018, 11.1% of American households, were food insecure, meaning they had difficulty providing enough food for all people within the house. Earlier this month the unemployment rate in the U.S. reached 14.7% with the Federal Reserve estimating it could reach a high of 25%. With the coronavirus devastating the U.S. and global economy, it can only be expected that these shocking poverty figures in the world’s richest and most powerful country will only increase significantly – this is not a problem only for the developing world.

Despite the increasing poverty and unemployment, there has been no discussion on significant scaling back the U.S.’ global militarism. In 2015, the U.S. had around 800 military bases in 50 foreign countries with 250,000 soldiers spread between them. There is little suggestion that these statistics have changed since then.

The U.S. is continuing its aggression around the world by orchestrating coup attempts in Venezuela, continual backing of jihadist groups in Syria, and sanction regimes against several countries. It appears as the U.S. economy continues to decline and large segments of the American people go deeper into poverty or enter destitution, Washington has no plans to carry out cost saving measures by reducing its monopoly of foreign bases around the globe or drawback its aggression against non-compliant independent states.

In January 1961, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower used his farewell address to warn that “an immense military establishment and a large arms industry” had emerged as a hidden force in U.S. politics and that Americans “must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.” Despite Eisenhower’s warning, it appears the American people have failed to understand its implications as profits for arms industries has taken precedence over poverty reduction that was caused by the failures of the Western liberal economy in handling the corovirus pandemic. The U.S. hegemony of foreign military bases and perpetual war is one to serve the profits of private arms companies at the expense of the American people.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been hospitalized in Moscow with a suspected coronavirus infection, Interfax reported Thursday.

Kadyrov, 43, was reportedly flown to the Russian capital Wednesday, a few days after reporting flu-like symptoms, the Baza Telegram channel reported earlier Thursday. Chechen doctors recommended that Kadyrov seek treatment there after his “condition began deteriorating rapidly,” Baza said.

The Telegram channel cited medical data as saying that Kadyrov has been diagnosed with lung damage and a suspected Covid-19 infection.

“He is under doctors’ supervision,” Interfax cited its source as saying.

A well-known transport tracker said Thursday that a private jet linked to Kadyrov arrived at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport from the Chechen capital of Grozny.

Kadyrov’s official page on Russian social network Vkontakte has posted several updates in the past 24 hours, including posts on his charitable donations and birthday greetings for Russia’s defense minister, but has not yet addressed his alleged infection.

Kadyrov was last active on his Telegram account on Tuesday, while Instagram blocked his page last week.

Everything’s fine if it fits the narrative, Bloomberg Opinion editors might have thought when they misquoted World Bank statistics on the number of hospital beds per 1,000 residents, including the misrepresented data in a Russia-bashing op-ed by Clara Ferreira Marques, titled ‘How Putin’s Russia Bungled the Pandemic’.

Taking a swipe at Russia’s efforts to upgrade the Soviet healthcare system to make it less cumbersome and more effective, the piece argued that the endeavor failed, only leading to a drop in hospitals, beds available, and doctors.

To back up the premise, the article featured a graph claiming to be based on 2013 data from the World Bank. However, according to the World Bank’s actual stats, while Russia had over twice as many beds in 2013 (8.2 versus 3.8 per 1,000), the initial version of the Bloomberg story had Russia lagging far behind the OECD countries by the same margin.

The blunder did not go unnoticed by the Russian Embassy in the US, which accused Bloomberg of promoting a new barrage of “politicized allegations” with “fake” stats.

“We demand that Bloomberg Opinion refute, apologize and respect its own customers,” the embassy said in a Facebook statement.

We are convinced that readers and viewers of the leading American media deserve verified, but not deliberately distorted, information.

Several hours after the embassy voiced its protest, Bloomberg Opinion amended the article, embedding a correct version of the graph instead of the misleading one.

The blunder came just days after Bloomberg ran another story about Covid-19 and Russia that raised some eyebrows. “Experts Want to Know Why Coronavirus Hasn’t Killed More Russians,” the initial headline stated, in what many commenters saw as the outlet’s disappointment in the country’s relatively low death toll. It has since been changed twice to sound more neutral.

Other Western media outlets seem to be taking the same misleading doom-and-gloom approach in covering Russia’s fight with the epidemic. Last week, CNN declared Moscow “devastated” based on the number of identified cases, which came with increasingly large-scale testing.

Meanwhile, the New York Times and Financial Times seem to imply that the Russian government is covering up the damage done by the epidemic with the creative use of official mortality statistics. The mystery of Russia’s low death toll was thus “solved” by the Western press. But when the Russian Embassy in the US tried to have the New York Times print comparative statistics for Moscow, New York City, and London to give readers some proper context, it refused, according to the diplomats.

3,https://theduran.com/new-evidence-suggests-the-united-states-government-may-have-engineered-covid-19/,The Duran,2020-05-21,['Malcolm Harris'],New Evidence Suggests the United States Government may have Engineered Covid-19,https://149425939.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dr.-Fauci.jpg,"The United States has a long history of using bioweapons against its own people.

On September 20, 1950, a US navy ship released a bioweapon into the air just off the coast of San Francisco in a deliberate attempt to experiment with its own population. The experiment resulted in at least one death and countless other infections. No one was prosecuted. In fact, the mainstream media almost completely ignores this piece of history.

Despite popular claims, Project MKUltra is not a conspiracy theory. According to documents uncovered under the Freedom of Information Act, the government illegally experimented on humans to discover means of mind control. Techniques that were used included high doses of psychoactive drugs, electroshocks, sensory deprivation, electroshocks, isolation, sexual abuse, and other forms of torture. These experiments were not just done on prisoners, it was done to innocent American citizens without their consent, including doctors, military personnel, and members of the general public. This information can all be found in wikipedia.

In one well known incident, government researchers, without informing the men they had the diseases, studied the effects of syphilis on African Americans. Afterwards, they deliberately withheld treatment to the men.

In addiction, there are countless other examples of incidents similar to those mentioned above.

After the sars outbreak in 2002, the United States government funded a collaboration of Chinese scientists and the US military from a bioweapons lab in Dort Detrick. Fort Detrick was the center of the U.S. biological weapons program from 1943 to 1969. After the program was discontinued, it served as the host for most elements of the United States biological defense program. It was also the grounds for Project MKUltra.

In 2002, Chinese scientists and a team of American scientists led by none-other than Dr. Fauci, teamed up to study the viruses effect on bat tissues. In addiction, they created what is called pandemic superbots. These were strains that were intentionally created to be more lethal than the strains occurring naturally. The fear of these strains being released alarmed other researchers. One Harvard professor told the Time magazine that Dr. Fauci’s work was intentionally weaponizing the virus. Despite this, Dr. Fauci’s work continued to be subsidized by the US government. Yes, I said the US government, not just the Chinese government.

Over the years, there were various incidents that resulted in the new weaponized virus from nearly being released. In response, in 2014, the US government terminated Fauci’s federal funding. This decision, however, did nothing to stop Fauci’s research. Instead, it just shifted the blame away from the US government over to the Chinese government. The research was then shifted to a military lab in a particular place in China. That place was Wuhan. Once the research was moved to Wuhan, the United States government reinstated its funds to the dangerous research. The amount given is thought to be around $3.7 million, although it is likely that it could be much higher.

Bat rectal swap research was also apart of Dr. Fauci’s research. Remember that the virus was alleged to have came from bats.

Three years later, in 2017, Dr. Fauci did an interview in which he claimed President Trump would face a global pandemic. “The history of the last 32 years that I have been the director of the NIAID will tell the next administration that there is no doubt they will be faced with the challenges their predecessors were faced with… We will definitely get surprised in the next few years.”

Indeed, we were surprised. Three years later, a virus similar to the SARS outbreak came about in the same place Dr. Fauci was creating another coronavirus strain at the same time he claimed a global pandemic would break out. Almost immediately after, the man in charge of these research is appointed to advise President Trump. Is this a coincidence? That’s up for you to decide.

If it is true that this virus was intentionally created and released by the United States, it is also worth noting why. There are many reasons to why the United States and China would intentionally release a bioweapon on its own populations. One theory is that the bankers and investors that control the United States government are using this crisis to dethrone the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, replacing it with an IMF based world currency. This currency would be used to even further their control over our monetary system and increase their wealth even more. We have already seen the United States unofficially endorse a IMF backed world currency. That however, can be discussed another time.

Regardless, these revelations should result in some serious questions being asked, including why the media has completely ignored this information and continues to hail Dr. Fauci as a hero.

4,https://theduran.com/montenegro-coronavirus-and-the-governments-fight-against-its-own-people/,The Duran,2020-05-20,['Anastasia Frank'],Montenegro: Coronavirus and the government’s fight against its own people,https://149425939.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/serbia-priest.jpg,"While most countries in the world are struggling with the coronavirus pandemic and its economic and social consequences, the youngest NATO member, Montenegro, is dealing with other problems.

Those “problems” are its own citizens, Montenegrins and Serbs, Orthodox Christians, followers of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who make up the majority of population in this country and who have been protesting since December 26, 2019 against the adoption of the Montenegrin Law on Religious Freedom, which practically allows the confiscation of the canonical Serbian Orthodox Church’s property, and ceding it to a the non-canonical and unrecognized “Montenegrin Orthodox Church”.

While the Montenegrin authorities haven’t really demonstrated much capability in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, they did show that they have a great potential for carrying out their western bosses’ orders. Namely, while Russian and Chinese experts helped Serbia deal with the coronavirus outbreak and its consequences, the Montenegrin authorities wouldn’t even consider asking Russia for help. Instead, they turned to NATO, which they joined in 2017, without holding a referendum. They also refused an offer from Serbia, which, despite its own problems with the procurement of medical equipment, suggested donating three respirators to this country during the pandemic. In return, they didn’t receive any of the much-needed medical equipment from NATO, only an offer for “taxi services”. This was also confirmed by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who in April, answering a question about NATO’s assistance to Montenegro, said that they offered the service of transporting equipment from China.

However, the inability to fight the virus, certainly didn’t mean that they weren’t able to fight against their own people and so-called political dissidents. Thus, on April 12, they arrested the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro, Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral Amfilohije, for holding a liturgy in a practically empty church where a small number of believers gathered following social-distancing rules. On April 23 they arrested the leader of the Democratic Front party Andrija Mandic for attending the funeral of a famous historian Vladimir Jovicevic. Maybe the real reason behind this arrest lies in the fact that the deceased was the father of the former Minister of Police Andrija Jovicevic who later became one of the biggest opponents of the Montenegrin president and oligarch Milo Djukanovic.

The terror against the Orthodox believers and the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church continued, even after easing of restrictive measures introduced due to the coronavirus outbreak was announced. On May 12, after the ban on large gatherings was lifted, the people in the northern town of Niksic organized a peaceful procession on their own initiative, in order to show their disagreement over the purge of the SOC. A few hours after the procession, the Montenegrin police arrested Bishop Joanikije along with eight priests, for allegedly disrespecting the rules during the procession. This caused an even greater revolt among the people, so on May 13, several liturgies and rallies in support of the arrested priests were organized throughout Montenegro. Tens of thousands of citizens attended rallies in Niksic, Budva, Pljevlja, Berane and other towns. The Montenegrin police responded to this with unprecedented brutality. In Niksic, they even arrested minors, and beat up a 16-year-old girl who was just trying to find her brother in all that chaos. In Podgorica, a man was arrested for having Serbian tricolor flag with him. In Pljevlja, seven policemen beat up a man, and a minor was injured during the conflict. At the same time, a Montenegrin analyst Bosko Vukicevic was arrested for supporting the protests.

They detained a journalist of the Belgrade newspaper “Novosti”, Velisa Kadic, whom the police previously pepper sprayed and forced to delete all the recorded material from his mobile phone. Bishop Joanikije was released from custody after 72 hours of the continuous protests in front of the prosecutor’s office building in Niksic. Political analysts interpret this situation and the excessive use of force as the growing nervousness of the leader of that country, Milo Djukanovic. Even the faith of the talks, initiated by Prime Minister Dusko Markovic before the pandemic, between the Montenegrin authorities and the representatives of the Serbian Orthodox Church is now uncertain. Although these talks did not yield any tangible results, they nevertheless represented and gave hope for a peaceful way of resolving the crisis and de-escalation of tensions. But after such an excessive use of force by the police towards the people, the road to uncertainty and possible escalation is now open.

In short, the crisis in the country began as a church crisis, but it turned into a democracy crisis, because Milo Djukanović persistently ignored the will of the majority of the people who protested peacefully.

Due to the crisis that arose after the arrest of Bishop Joanikij and all the events related to the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro, representatives of Serbian political, cultural and intellectual circles requested a conversation with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. After the talks, the President of Serbia said May 14 that Serbia cannot interfere in any way but “will remain by our people and the church as much as we can”. Vucic said that the Serbian representatives from Montenegro conveyed their fears regarding the future of the Serbian people in that country:

“During the conversation, a concern was voiced – that someone might plan to solve the problem in the same way it was solved in other parts of former Yugoslavia. I do not believe, nor do I want to believe that someone’s planning it, but I’m still worried as the president of Serbia”, said Vucic.

What did the representatives of the Serbs in Montenegro mean when they expressed fear that some might want to “solve the problem” the same way as in other countries of the former Yugoslavia? What they had in mind is the ethnic cleansing of Serbs from Croatia during the Croatian military operations “Storm” and “Flash” (in 1995), when about 250,000 Serbs were expelled from their homes, and more than 2,000 civilians were killed or are still listed as missing.

It is interesting to note that the Montenegrin leadership claims that there has not been a single case of coronavirus infection in this country for almost two weeks now, and that since the beginning of the pandemic they’ve had only a total of 324 infected, 9 have died and 311 have been cured. Whether these are accurate data or not we cannot know at the moment, but we know that Montenegro is the only country in the Balkans that refused Serbia’s help, and never even asked it from Russia, a historical ally of this Balkan country. In return, they received nothing from their West. With the help of Russia and China, Serbia is successfully fighting against the coronavirus and its economic consequences. On the other hand the Montenegrin authorities are not doing anything to suppress the economic consequences. They have not helped the private sector or the economy as a whole, and they do not have a well-thought-out strategy for the country’s recovery. With an attitude like this, they are putting in danger the already uncertain tourist season. The head of the State Duma committee for the development of civil society and issues of public and religious associations, Sergei Gavrilov, stated that due to repressive measures in Montenegro, it is not certain that Russia will resume air traffic with that country.

All this can cause additional dissatisfaction among the people and lead to a worsening of the economic and social environment. Financial flows in Montenegro have two sources – a legal and an illegal; tourism being the legal and drug trafficking the illegal one. The population lives from tourism, and smuggling remains the source of income for the pyramidal ruling apparatus in Montenegro. Since the tourist season will probably collapse due to the pandemic and internal destabilization, a great dissatisfaction can be expected among the population. As for the other source of money, during the previous months, its ground is currently shaky. An example of this is the seizure of 500 kilograms of cocaine in Hamburg from a ship owned by Montenegro, which, although leased, is certainly an indication that something is happening in Montenegro in that regard. The case of the seizure is being investigated by the European police, as well as some American agencies. If the income from that side is cut off, there will be less money for the maintenance of the governing apparatus. So, everything indicates the start of an overall crisis, not only considering the church, protests, the security aspect, and the opening of a series of investigations into scandals, but also the worsening of the economic and social environment. Since Montenegro proclaimed independence in 2006, it has been almost entirely in the service of the United States. In 2008, under American pressure, they recognized the independence of the so-called Kosovo, and in 2014, the authorities of this country were among the first to impose sanctions on Russia, although Russia was the largest investor in Montenegrin tourism and economy after 2006.The Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro remains by far the only institution that the puppet regime failed to bring under control after the declaration of independence and after joining NATO, according to some estimates, against the will of about 85% of the citizens. The adoption of the Law on Religious Freedom in December 2019 was the final blow to the church and Orthodox believers in this country.

It is difficult to predict the further development of the situation and the fate of Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro. But one thing is clear. The coronavirus pandemic showed that western countries had little or no solidarity during the crises, and they demonstrated little capability to cope with the pandemic. At the same time, Western Balkans countries would hardly be able to cope with it without Russian and Chinese aid. After all this, we can only observe the weakening of the western influence in the Balkans, not only in Serbia but also in other neighboring countries, which is why the Montenegrin authorities feel that they might be in big trouble. Internally, the land and resources have been sold to the West, and externally, they have been in a vassal position throughout their rule. Unable to solve any real problems, faced with the consequences of the virus and dissatisfaction of its citizens, they are resorting to repressive measures against their own people. Judging by the number of citizens that can be seen in the streets every day, it seems that they have little chance of success. It remains to be seen whether this might turn out to be the one of the final steps in the collapse of Western influence in the Balkans.

Italy, whose already week economy has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic, should seek help from its own wealthy citizens, rather than relying on Germany and other EU countries, to bail it out as it struggles to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic, former German MEP and economist, Hans-Olaf Henkel, has warned.

According to The Express, the German suggested that the best solution would be for Italy to leave the eurozone and go back to their own currency, which he dubbed the “new lira”. Henkel was speaking against the backdrop of widening splits between the north and the south of the bloc, and particularly Germany and Italy, on how best to mitigate the economic and societal impacts of the virus.

He wasn’t alone: at a time when the European periphery has been hoping to get loans, or better yet, grants from Europe, Manfred Weber, leader of the European People’s Party in the European Parliament, became the latest figure to speak out, calling for “strict controls” to prevent Italy and Spain embarking on massive public spending sprees using EU cash.

Henkel was also responding to comments by liberal billionaire and europhile George Soros, who last week suggested the EU had a duty to help Italy, which has been hit harder by the disease than anywhere else in the bloc, by spreading the cost of rebuilding the country’s economy among members of the eurozone. The former MEP explained: “I share Soros’ views on Italy but do not believe that there is any justification to show ‘financial solidarity with Italy because of the corona crisis’.

“What have Germans to do with the decisions taken by Italian politicians on their health system or the (very late) decisions on the lockdown in Lombardy”

He also noted that “on average the per capita wealth of Italians is way above the wealth of for instance Germans” and added that “before Italian politicians like Salvini or Conte or anybody claims money from citizens of other countries to mitigate the financial results of their decisions they should ask their own wealthy people to show solidarity with their own people.”

“Rather than letting Italian politicians borrow money from and at the risk of other countries, Germany should make a generous gift in exchange for Italy leaving the eurozone and go back to their own currency (New Lira)! This way Italy’s Central Bank could devalue their currency to become competitive again, get the economy back on its (own) feet and prosper like Italy did before the euro” Henkel said.

The German economist, who stressed his respect for a “globalized, liberal and democratic world”, added: “I know Soros from a meeting some years ago when we discussed the first euro crisis.”

“At that time I advocated the euro to be split into a ‘Northern Euro’ and a ‘Euro for the South’, in each case the currency to reflect the different economic realities prevailing in, for example, Greece, Italy and France on one hand and, for instance, in Austria, The Netherlands and Germany on the other.”

Addressing a proposed solution, namely “perpetual bonds”, or loans which would never have to be repaid, he added: “Soros’ idea of eternal European loans may work on a national basis like they did in the UK and in the US in World War 1, but they would not work on a European level.

“Not only would we be confronted with the same moral hazard such as in the case of euro- or coronabonds, they would also be limited to the eurozone hence create a new border within Europe.”

“On one side are those with solidarity for Italy like Germany. On the other are those without like Denmark or Sweden or Poland, none of them being in the eurozone.”

And that’s why Europe is doomed – the same reason European nations and people have been doomed to waging war with each other for millennia – because when one strips away the profit motive and the distraction that is the pursuit of wealth, everyone hates everyone, and once the money runs out and the shared prosperity ends and is replaced by the shared pain of bailing out one’s neighbor, at that point it’s just a matter of time before the time of death is declared.

The anti-China campaign in the U.S. is nearing its climax. Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn wrote a letter to colleagues calling for them to be careful when working with Chinese officials, or better, to avoid contact with them. Last week, Republican senators proposed a bill that would allow President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on China if there is no comprehensive review of China’s role in the spread of coronavirus. Lawmakers requested the investigation within 60 days, as well as confirm the closure of the so-called wet markets in China, in addition to the release of arrested Hong Kong rioters. They also propose to freeze Chinese assets in the U.S., impose travel bans, tighten visas, and restrict Chinese businesses from accessing U.S. banking and capital markets.

Washington continued its online visa war with China by limiting visas to Chinese journalists working in the U.S. for 90 days. Chinese media outlet Xinhua called the decision an unprecedented act of discrimination and pressure on Chinese journalists. This completely exposed the false pretence of the U.S. claims of “freedom of the press,” a spokesperson of the agency said.

Trump’s announcement yesterday that the U.S. could completely end its relationship with China due to the pandemic has seen China harshly reacting, with suggestions that itself might put sanctions on the U.S.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also called on alleged forces related to China to stop stealing coronavirus research data after the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security made the accusation. It is likely however that Trump uses the charges against China primarily for his own political purposes as he lost complete control of the coronavirus that has seen over 1.5 million Americans infected and around 90,000 dead.

For the sake of winning the upcoming election he will continue to target China, but will unlikely break ties with Beijing because American businesses will lose a market of 1.4 billion people. The pandemic has shown that the U.S. has missed an opportunity to be a world leader which will now force Washington to rethink its position in the world.

The U.S. understand they have a long way to go before reaching the end of the pandemic. Meanwhile, China is approaching the end of it. Economically, China is winning which is why Washington is trying to curb China politically. It is for this reason Washington is now using the “Taiwanese card.”

Pompeo said World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus “chose not to invite Taiwan under pressure from the People’s Republic of China. The Director-General’s lack of independence deprives the Assembly of Taiwan’s renowned scientific expertise on pandemic disease, and further damages the WHO’s credibility and effectiveness at a time when the world needs it the most.”

Washington’s focus on China is a distraction, a relatively simple way to disguise their own faults, and the charges against the WHO serves the same purpose. It is passing on the blame of Trump’s inefficient handling of the pandemic just as we push closer to the next U.S. elections.

Member states of the Five Eyes intelligence structure, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Canada, or what should be more accurately called the Anglo Five, also contributed to the campaign against China. These countries support the U.S. call for an inquiry into the role of WHO and China in the fight against the pandemic, and some, despite Beijing’s strong opposition, have supported Taiwan’s invitation to join the World Health Assembly. According to Canadian radio company CBC that quoted a senior Canadian government official, French, German and Japanese ambassadors at the United Nations in Geneva, along with Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, British and the American ones at a meeting with senior WHO officials voiced support for inviting Taiwan to join this international organization

Despite the provocations and using Taiwan provocatively, the People’s Bank of China issued a license to Fitch Bohua, owned by U.S. company Fitch Raitings, to conduct business in the Chinese market, according to information released on May 14. The company is allowed to value some bonds in China’s interbank stock market. The acceptance of Fitch Raitings into the Chinese market is part of the first phase agreement of China-U.S. trade. In addition, as part of this transaction, the Chinese government today will cancel additional import duties on the second shipment from the U.S.

However, Chinese state-owned Global Times, considered an influential voice in Chinese policymaking, said Beijing is running out of patience. It appears China could be deliberately leaking information to the media and is planning serious sanctions, particularly against two organizations and several individuals who have sued China in U.S. courts. The Chinese outlet explained how to inflict the most painful economic damage on these American organizations and individuals, and urged Beijing to do this instead of making angry statements and symbolic gestures.

It is unlikely that China, or even the U.S., will sever relations or impose sanctions. Although the U.S. political class may be against China, for the billionaires and major business owners, anti-Chinese actions are against their own financial interests. For this fact, it is likely Trump is only using strong rhetoric in the lead up to the upcoming election to distract Americans from his own mishandling of the pandemic.

Despite the tempting partisan narrative, though, many never left their cars.

Anti-lockdown demonstrators traveled hundreds of miles to attend protests, almost certainly spreading the coronavirus to places where infections were rare, according to the Committee to Protect Medicare, a supposedly non-partisan group run by a former Democratic congressional candidate. The group provided a comprehensive analysis of smartphone location data from rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado and Florida to the Guardian on Monday.

While the Committee to Protect Medicare admitted it had no real evidence to support its claim that demonstrators were callously spreading the infection that has killed tens of thousands of people while paralyzing the world economy, “it’s hard to draw a straight line between devices, individuals at these protests, and cases,” executive director Rob Davidson acknowledged. They insisted the demonstrators’ behavior “carries a high risk of infection.”

Virus transmission at some of those demonstrations would have been next to impossible, however, since protesters remained in their cars. Demonstrators at an “Operation Gridlock” protest in Denver in late April descended on the city en masse in their vehicles, waving signs and flags while deliberately snarling traffic as they demanded an end to Colorado Governor Jared Polis’ stay-at-home order. While some left their cars to picket the Capitol building, photos of the event suggested that even the majority of the sign-wavers maintained safe distances between each other.

The demonstrators’ phones were tracked by mobile advertising firm VoteMap for 48 hours after they attended the anti-lockdown protests, revealing participants had in some cases traveled hundreds of miles, and even crossed state lines. While data analysts took care to specify that the location data had been taken only from apps in which the user had “opted in” to being tracked as part of the apps’ terms of service, it’s unlikely any of the protesters were aware that their locations were being tracked for use in a partisan smear campaign. VoteMap used anonymized data from hundreds of different apps to create its graphics. Many apps bury their authorization for use of location data deep in prohibitively-lengthy terms of service.

The Committee to Protect Medicare did not specify the dates of many of the demonstrations it tracked, other than the April 19 Denver protest – in which healthcare workers reportedly confronted the anti-lockdown demonstrators – and an April 30 protest in Lansing, Michigan that made international news after gun-toting demonstrators brought their weapons into the state capitol.

Mainstream media have gone the extra mile to portray anti-lockdown protesters as gun-waving pro-Trump racists who don’t care about the common good, even when the reality does not quite live up to expectations. The same day the armed protesters “invaded” the capitol in Lansing, Covid-19 cases in Michigan increased by 1,191 – unrelated incidents the media nevertheless tried to connect.

The state has recorded 4,891 deaths with coronavirus as of Sunday, with 42 percent of those in people over 80. Similarly, Colorado has logged 878 deaths specifically due to Covid-19, over half of them in people over 80 years old.
