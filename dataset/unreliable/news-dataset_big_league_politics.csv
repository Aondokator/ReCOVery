The father of the assailant is speaking out, saying that his son suffers from serious mental illness and was quarantined in a nursing home with at-risk elderly people after testing positive for COVID-19.

Kimberly Craig of WXYZ 7 ABC broke the insane news that shows how the most vulnerable are being put at risk due to the decisions of government bureaucrats and the so-called first responders.

“He has issues and for them to put him in a facility like that, nothing good was going to happen,” the suspect’s father said to 7 Action News.

In addition to having a history of mental illness, the assailant has an assault case that is pending in Washtenaw County. This highly dangerous individual was put around vulnerable people who he could brutalize as well as possibly infect with COVID-19.

The assailant’s father said that his son had been taken to a group home for supervision, but had a mental health relapse as he was hearing voices in his head. When he was taken to the University of Michigan Hospital for supervision as a result, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. That is when he was taken to the Westwood Nursing Center where he would commit his savage assault.

It is unknown whether or not the nursing home called the police to alert them about the assault that had taken place in their facilities. The assailant is currently in police custody, and it is yet to be determined if he will be charged for what he did.

The sickening video of the assault can be seen here:

“He never should have been housed.. quarantined with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,” the father said. “Someone dropped the ball.”

The person who dropped the ball may have been Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who issued a directive that forced COVID-19 patients to be housed in nursing homes.

Big League Politics reported on how state Democrats are turning on Whitmer for essentially issuing death sentences to the elderly with her incomprehensible and arguably genocidal policy prescriptions:

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s heavy-handed authoritarian governance has made her a pariah throughout the state, and Democrats are starting to become frustrated with her leadership as a result. State representative Leslie Love (D-Detroit) is flabbergasted over Whitmer’s order to send coronavirus patients into nursing homes, which has resulted in an untold number of unnecessary deaths by putting the most vulnerable population at needless risk. “To return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn’t seem — it’s not a good idea,” Love said. Whitmer made an executive order in April that mandated seniors diagnosed with COVID-19 to be placed into nursing homes, called “regional hubs,” to be around other healthy seniors. State officials claim that the policy is effective because of distance requirements that are required between the healthy and unhealthy seniors. “It’s a good move, a good step to make these regional hubs, and I think as we move forward, we have to look at making sure we’re really implementing best practices, looking to other best practices across the state,” Chief Medical Executive Joneigh S. Khaldun said. Initially, the state wanted to put the sick seniors at the TCF Center in Detroit but that became untenable after the site was shut down. This meant seniors with coronavirus were put into nursing homes among the vulnerable instead. Love is worried about individuals in nursing homes throughout the state, including her 86-year-old mother, catching the highly-infectious disease. “That would break my heart because I’ve been on the front lines of this, trying to make sure our seniors — my mother, your mother, anybody else’s mother — does not get sick and die from this, particularly if they’re in a nursing home,” Love said.

Complicit government officials like Whitmer want to keep the panic going so they cannot be held accountable for their crimes against humanity in how they have responded to the pandemic.",12.5,Low,Right

Petrovsky, who does research for Flinders University in Austria, has come to the conclusion that the virus was optimized to penetrate human cells rather than animal cells. Barring some “remarkable coincidence,” Petrovsky believes this means the virus was engineered to attack humans.

Lifesite News, who broke the story, reported that the scientists “used a version of the novel coronavirus collected in the earliest days of the outbreak and applied computer models to test its capacity to bind to certain cell receptor enzymes, called “ACE2,” that allow the virus to infect human and animal cells to varying degrees of efficacy.”

Scientists discovered that “the novel coronavirus most powerfully binds with human ACE2, and with variously lesser degrees of effectiveness with animal versions of the receptor.” They believe this means SARS-CoV-2 “became specialized for human cell penetration by living previously in human cells, quite possibly in a laboratory.”

The study explains its conclusions by stating that “a virus would be expected to have highest affinity for the receptor in its original host species, e.g. bat, with a lower initial binding affinity for the receptor of any new host, e.g. humans. However, in this case, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher for humans than for the putative original host species, bats, or for any potential intermediary host species.”

The study notes a “possibility which still cannot be excluded is that SARSCoV-2 was created by a recombination event that occurred inadvertently or consciously in a laboratory handling coronaviruses, with the new virus then accidentally released into the local human population.”

Petrovsky believes the virus was cultured to evolve over time, meaning that this could have been many years in the making.

“Our and other analyses of the genomic sequence of the virus do not reveal any artificial gene inserts that would be the hallmark of a gene jockey, genetic engineers who manipulate or even create viruses by splicing in artificial inserts into their genome.” Petrovsky said.

Big League Politics has noted that even the mainstream experts admit that the age of bioweapon is at hand and individuals should be very concerned with the possibility of these being set off:

Just months before the coronavirus pandemic hit the world, scientists at Cambridge University warned of the reality of race-specific bioweapons. Cambridge University’s Center for the Study of Existential Risk released their report last summer to tell world governments that they urgently need to prepare for this threat, or otherwise they would potentially deal with its lethal ramifications after it’s already too late. They called for independent groups to be formed to study technology and how it can be used as a weapon to target populations, and come up with ways to solve them through rules, regulations and other protocols. “The technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated at ever cheaper prices, democratizing the ability to harm more quickly and lethally,” the authors of the report wrote. “In a particularly bad case, a bio-weapon could be built to target a specific ethnic group based on its genomic profile.” The coronavirus pandemic may signal that the worst fears of these researchers has come to life. Although globalist authority figures, Chinese communist tyrants, and social media commissars want to mute the concerns, whistleblowers have sounded the alarm about coronavirus strain possibly being a bioweapon.

If Petrovsky mysteriously disappears in the upcoming days, it is probably not a coincidence.",12.5,Low,Right

Trump told his administration members while he was signing the order that it “gives you tremendous power to cut regulation.” The order pertains to “instructing federal agencies to use any and all authority to waive, suspend and eliminate unnecessary regulations that impede economic recovery.”

Trump made it clear when he signed the executive order that he hopes this regulatory relief becomes permanent.

Trump has made axing the administrative state, meaning the massive federal bureaucracy that strangles economic growth, a constant priority throughout his tenure in the White House.

Big League Politics has reported on how Trump’s deregulation push has driven liberals up the wall:

President Donald Trump has rolled out his new coal deregulation plan, and it is causing frantic liberals to claim it is the end of the world. Vanity Fair released a hyperbolic article about Trump’s common sense plan to let the states decide their own carbon emissions policies. The article claims that this federalist plan to abide by the Constitution would cause thousands of deaths as well as an increase in diseases. “We’re on the right side of history,” Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler said to the New York Times, infuriating liberals even further. What has liberals really spooked is the inevitable court challenges to Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy rule. They are worried that the Supreme Court, bolstered by two conservative justices appointed by Trump, could set a precedent making it very difficult for future presidents to ever address their much-ballyhooed climate crisis. While liberals complain about these new policies from their ivory towers, the Senators from West Virginia are happy about the changes made by President Trump that will help the blue collar workers in their state. “Our emissions are on a downward slope and have been without a Clean Power Plan, and we’re going to keep moving towards that way regardless of what regulation we have in order because we know it’s better for the environment and the health of people,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said. Even her Democratic counterpart has to admit that Trump’s policy is a step forward from the policies of his predecessor. “I never supported the CPP because it required coal plants to install emission controls that were not “commercially proven” at the time. It is unreasonable to ask power plants to utilize technologies that do not yet exist, and penalize them if they don’t. For this reason and others, the regulation became a subject of intense litigation causing further uncertainty for our power sector. While we are still reviewing the final rule and its implications, the rule does offer fossil plants greater compliance flexibility, which I support,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said.

While liberals use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to shred the Constitution and let dangerous criminals out of jail, Trump makes power moves that actually help the American people.",12.5,Low,Right

He wrote in his post: “Exercise this right! I’m not telling you who or what party to vote for… I’m just asking you if you want another four years with a #Racist, #elitist , #misogynist , #lying , #narcissistic, #self-righteous, #undignified , #hypocrite , #moronic , #traitorous , #unpatriotic , #autocratic , #selfserving ,#fingerpointing buffoon like @realdonaldtrump and the @gop stooges that continue to support him? @realdonaldtrump supporters google the words you don’t understand! Also google penile dysmorphic disorder while you’re at it.”

Bautista apparently did not realize that many pro wrestling fans are conservative and support Trump, who has made many appearances on pro wrestling shows throughout the years and is a great friend of WWE owner Vince McMahon. Many Facebook comments blasted Bautista for his offensive political beliefs.

“And your any better calling him and his supporter names?? I am all for everyone picking who they want but don’t be a hypocrite,” wrote one individual in response.

“Anyone who would support mail in ballots supports corruption and fraud. Nice job tough guy,” someone else wrote.

“I had so much respect for you… now it is gone. Guess California got you too… such a shame,” a former Bautista fan commented.

“We had the racist president, we replaced him with President Trump,” someone else wrote in a comment.

“Batista just used hashtags for everything he is. Get lost and go preach somewhere else,” a disappointed former fan wrote.

“Wow!! Thought you had more class than this. Nice to see your true self. You could of just said “Vote” or something along those lines. Can see you’re full of hate, that’s what’s wrong with the world today,to much hate,” someone else posted in a Facebook comment.

“We all have our own opinions in this world. We all don’t see eye to eye and that’s ok. However, name calling or bashing the other side/people is not cool. I thought you had more respect for others. Very disappointed,” another individual wrote.

Bautista is a star of the Guardians of the Galaxy series, which is directed by James Gunn. Gunn has been exposed for a series of bizarre and disgusting Twitter “jokes” about sex with children.

After his posts were exposed and he was disgraced and fired, Gunn was quietly re-hired to direct the series by Disney after the cast including Bautista begged for his reinstatement despite comments that seemingly promoted or at least trivialized pedophilia:

Hollywood director James Gunn, who was fired by Disney after thousands of his pro-pedophile tweets surfaced, has been rehired months later to direct the third installment to “Guardians of the Galaxy.” Deadline reports that Gunn was rehired by Disney two months ago, and that they believe the massive outrage over Gunn’s disgusting pro-pedophile tweets is no big deal because it was led by “alt right journalists.” Gunn was fired after 10,000 disgusting tweets featuring lines like “I like it when little boys touch me in my silly place,” “The Expendables was so manly I f*cked the sh*t out of the little p*ssy boy next to me,” and “‘Eagle Snatches Kid’ is what I call it when I get lucky.” surfaced on social media. The majority of observers were rightly disgusted, but Gunn attempted to claim these tweets were being misconstrued by “alt right journalists.” Occasional #NeverTrump conservative Ben Shapiro likely paved the way for Gunn’s return by defending the pro-pedophile director last year as the rest of the right wing media was unified in its utter disgust.

Bautista should stick to injecting steroids and reciting canned lines on camera rather than expressing his ignorant political opinions if he wants to keep his fan base.",12.5,Low,Right
