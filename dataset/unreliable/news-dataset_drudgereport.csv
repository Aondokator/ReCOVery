Why it matters: The virus doesn't care about politics or geography. High-risk behavior in places where the virus is spreading is the recipe for an outbreak.

Map courtesy of the Brookings Institute. Note: High-risk counties are counties with at least 100 cases per 100,000 residents, as of May 17.

The big picture: For the last four weeks, counties newly designated as having a high prevalence of coronavirus cases — meaning at least 100 cases per 100,000 people — were more likely to have voted for President Trump than Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a recent analysis by the Brookings Institution.

The most recently identified counties tend to be in the South and the Midwest.

Between March 29 and May 17, the portion of Americans living in high-prevalence counties rose from 8% to 79%.

What they're saying: ""This suggests that rhetoric from some of the president’s supporters against maintaining public health measures may become more muted, as the nation continues to grapple with the many unknowns about COVID-19’s continued spread,"" writes William Frey, the author of the analysis.

Yes, but: That's not happening.

Republicans are more willing than Democrats or independents to partake in activities that involve interacting with other people, per new polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Two-thirds of Republicans said either that the pandemic isn't a major problem or that the ""worst is behind us."" On the other hand, 70% of Democrats and half of independents said that the ""the worst is yet to come.""

The bottom line: How people feel about the coronavirus will undoubtedly impact the kinds of risks they are willing to take, which will in turn impact the extent of future outbreaks."

LOS ANGELES — While some parts of the country are seeing major progress in fighting the coronavirus, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, on Friday singled out Los Angeles as one of three regions where persistent spread remains a significant concern.

Speaking with reporters at the White House, Birx gave a mostly upbeat assessment of the nation’s progress but said the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which includes Orange County, is continuing to see problems, along with Washington, D.C., and Chicago.

“Even though Washington has remained closed, L.A. has remained closed, Chicago has remained closed, we still see these ongoing cases,” she said.

Brix asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with those areas “to really understand where are these new cases coming from, and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.”

Los Angeles County is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in California, accounting for about 56% of the state’s total deaths and almost half of nearly 90,000 confirmed infections. The county’s death toll rose Thursday to 2,021, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases.

“This is a very sad milestone for us,” county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thursday after the deaths exceeded 2,000.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said she hoped officials could ease stay-at-home restrictions soon but urged caution.

“I wish that we could speed things up,” she said. “The virus is still out there waiting for us to let our guard down.”

Despite the average daily death toll, which has remained at a stubborn plateau for weeks, there were new signs that even Los Angeles is beginning to turn the corner.

The coronavirus transmission rate in the nation’s most populous county is now in its best position since the magnitude of the outbreak became clear in March.

Still, officials remain concerned that warm temperatures and quarantine fatigue could drive people from their homes over the Memorial Day weekend, resulting in crowding at parks and beaches that could threaten to undo some of the progress the state has made.

In San Francisco, the parks department painted 10-foot circles on the grass of four city parks ahead of the holiday weekend to remind visitors to follow social distancing rules.

It’s part of a pilot program based on a similar effort at Domino Park in Brooklyn, said Tamara Barak Aparton, spokeswoman for San Francisco Recreation and Parks.

“It’s going to be warm this weekend and we knew people would be out, so we thought it would be a good time to get feedback on whether this helps,” Aparton said. If successful, the circles could be expanded to more locations, she said.

In Orange County, several coastal cities expanded their beach hours and planned to open more parking lots connected to the shoreline ahead of the holiday.

Seal Beach, which initially allowed public access only Mondays through Thursdays from sunrise to sunset, is now welcoming beachgoers from 4:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, officials said earlier this week. Some beach parking lots also reopened. Beaches are open for active use only.

A few miles south, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach also are allowing beach access on weekends, ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Newport is now open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., while Huntington Beach opens an hour earlier.

Laguna Beach, however, is maintaining stricter hours on Saturdays and Sundays, with its coastline closing at noon each day.

While Los Angeles County beaches also have reopened for active use, only some parking lots are open.

In addition to the reduced transmission rate, L.A. County has seen other encouraging indicators, including a 12% decrease in its latest seven-day average of deaths per day and a 15% decrease in its most recent three-day average for hospitalizations per day, Ferrer said Thursday.

“The progress we’ve made in slowing the spread, the reduction in the average daily deaths and hospitalizations and retaining capacity in our health care system — this lets us know that the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices made by all of you are working,” she said. “As a community, we’ve done this together, and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.”

Still, she said, officials will continue to keep a close eye on those metrics to ensure they don’t creep up as more people are out in the public due to businesses and recreation areas reopening.

“Through our recovery journey, as we’re all out of our homes more, it may become more difficult to slow the spread, but it is far from impossible,” she said.

Though experts say it’s still too soon for L.A. County to move into a more aggressive phase of recovery, much of California has progressed to a point where officials feel it’s safe to lift more of the state’s stay-at-home order and allow more businesses to reopen.

The number of new coronavirus cases across the state declined from the previous week, and hospitalizations have dropped more than 15% from a peak six weeks ago, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis.

Most counties have received approval to progress more quickly through Phase 2 of the state’s reopening road map — meaning they can open restaurant dining rooms and more retail businesses for in-store shopping.

The list of counties that can ramp up their reopening efforts now includes San Diego — the state’s second-most populous — Kern, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura.

That comes as officials revealed that California’s unemployment rate nearly tripled from mid-March to mid-April, with the state losing an unprecedented 2.3 million payroll jobs across all sectors of its economy as a result of the pandemic.

April’s jobless rate skyrocketed to 15.5%, up from 5.5% a month before, sweeping past the Great Recession’s peak of 12.3% a decade ago, state officials reported Friday.

The Golden State’s jobless rate is higher than the nationwide rate of 14.7%, reflecting California’s reliance on tourism, hospitality and entertainment businesses.

Still, some local officials are urging tourists to stay away — at least for now. Multiple counties have expressed concern about people visiting and possibly bringing with them the coronavirus, especially during the Memorial Day weekend.

Dr. Penny Borenstein, San Luis Obispo County’s health officer, asked tourists to not visit as the county reopened many shops and restaurants this week. While officials have performed “spot checks” with hotels to deter tourism, Borenstein said the county would cite visitors only in the case of “egregious violations.”

Remote Alpine County urged tourists to stay away when the virus began to spread through California in March.

Dr. Richard Johnson, the Alpine County public health officer, said last month there’s no medical care to treat visitors who fall ill with COVID-19.

“There’s no way we would even have ground or air resources to get them out,” Johnson said. “It’s a dangerous assumption that you can come and look at us as a safe haven. It is an unsafe haven.”

Communities in the Lake Tahoe region, which heavily depend on tourism as well, have issued reminders before the holiday weekend warning that leisure travel is not permitted.

On its website, the city of South Lake Tahoe said that while second homeowners are now welcome, other visitors are still not. Lodging will not be available to short-term renters.

“We would love nothing more than to welcome everyone to Tahoe right now, but that’s not the safest way to bring people back to South Lake,” City Manager Joe Irvin said in a statement. “We need to be responsible and make sure we are doing our part to keep our neighbors safe and Tahoe safe while adhering to the governor’s stay at home orders.”

“Now you’re in this trough and what voters are going to do is they’re going to wait and render a verdict once they’ve assessed the job President Trump has done to bring the economy back into recovery coming out of the pandemic,” he added.

Following the PRRI survey, which was conducted while Trump was a dominant presence at televised daily briefings by his administration's coronavirus task force, Pew Research Center released new data last week that showed a 7-point increase from April to May in white Catholics who disapprove of Trump’s response to the Covid-19 crisis and a 6-point decline among white evangelicals who previously gave him positive marks.

Trump campaign aides, White House officials and outside allies are responding to the threat by boosting their outreach to religious voters and promising to prioritize religious gatherings as they push to reopen the U.S. economy. Administration officials have conducted multiple calls with conservative Christian groups to ensure their support over the past two months. Trump himself recently attended an online worship service hosted by St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. And Vice President Mike Pence held a roundtable with faith leaders in Iowa earlier this month. Reed said his organization is planning a get-out-the-vote campaign three times as large as its effort in 2016.

The president’s reelection operation “will engage the Christian community nationwide to overwhelmingly reelect President Trump in 2020,” Trump campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso said in a statement.

“In addition to his extraordinary record on conservative and faith-based issues, he has appointed well over 180 solid, conservative federal judges … defended religious freedoms and has stood as the most pro-life president we’ve ever had,” Farnaso added.

On Thursday, Trump also floated a potential move by his administration to reopen houses of worship in the near future.

“The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,” Trump said as he left the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. “I want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.”

Some Trump allies have attributed the recent slump in the president’s support to the closure of churches that Trump addressed on Friday. Social-distancing guidelines forced most churches to suspend in-person worship or move Sunday services into the virtual sphere, and one member of the Trump campaign’s “Evangelicals for Trump” coalition suggested that faith leaders and parishioners who have been frustrated by the limitations are mistakenly blaming Trump. (Religious institutions in Kentucky, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana and California have all brought legal challenges against their states for restrictions on religious activities and gatherings.)

“Those who don’t understand the legalities of the process could be blaming the president or the administration when the federal government is dealing with states’ rights issues,” said Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor and prominent Trump supporter.

It was not immediately clear whether the president's order on Friday — that state and local officials must take immediate action to reopen religious institutions — was legally permissible, nor was it clear how administration officials planned to enforce the guidance.

Guidelines released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about reopening certain establishments — including schools, public transit systems and child care facilities — did not mention how religious institutions should go about returning to in-person worship services and ministry opportunities. One senior administration official said the guidance was omitted due to concerns that the prescriptions CDC staffers planned to provide were too restrictive.

It’s unlikely that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump’s favorability among critical religious demographics. According to the Pew survey, 43 percent of white evangelicals and 52 percent of white Catholics think the current restrictions on public activity in their areas are appropriate versus 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, who think fewer restrictions would be better. Greater shares of white evangelicals and white Catholics also said they are more afraid about their state governments lifting restrictions on public activity too soon than they are about leaving the restrictions in place for too long.

As the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it’s likely become harder for the president’s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual supporters might become of his overall response.

“If grandma’s retirement home is suffering from an outbreak, there’s pretty good evidence that something is awry and it makes it difficult to ignore what public health experts are saying,” Gifford said. “This is something where that is harder to ignore than previous controversies or crises because it has life-and-death consequences for congregations and religious populations.”

Part of the strategy Trump allies have adopted to protect his relationship with conservative Christians is to frame the novel coronavirus — and church closures in response to social distancing restrictions — as a threat to religious freedom. The president’s religious supporters routinely cite religious liberty as one of their top priorities and an area in which they believe the Trump administration has been exceptionally receptive."

The devastating toll of coronavirus is far-reaching, but the impact of the pandemic is particularly acute among black Americans and Latinos, who are nearly three times as likely to personally know someone who has died from the virus than white Americans, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday.

Thirty percent of black adults and 26% of Latino adults in the country said they know a victim of the coronavirus, who died either from the disease or from complications related to the virus. For white adults, the corresponding figure is 10%.

The findings are consistent with local and national data reported by states and cities and reviewed by ABC News that revealed racial and ethnic minorities suffer a disproportionate share of the negative health and economic outcomes from the coronavirus pandemic.

For example, in New York City, the site of one of the worst hot spots in the country, black Americans and Latinos are two times more likely to be hospitalized and to die from COVID-19 than whites.

In Louisiana, although black residents only comprise a third of the population, they accounted for 70% of the deaths in the state, as of last month.

The new poll, which was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos’ Knowledge Panel, comes as the death toll approaches 100,000 and confirmed cases of COVID-19 top 1.5 million in the country. All 50 states have at least partially reopened this week, ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, as President Donald Trump continues his push to revive the economy amid the continued risk of the pandemic.

Do you personally know anyone who has died from the coronavirus or from complications related to the coronavirus, or not? ABC News/Ipsos Poll

As testing across the country increases and becomes more available, overwhelming majorities of Americans are confident they both know where to get tested and can access testing for the virus.

Among all Americans, 77% said they are confident that they would know where to go for testing if they suspected they had been infected. Additionally, 71% of Americans said they are confident they could get tested if they needed to.

Majorities across racial groups are confident they would know where to go for testing and think they could successfully get tested. However, racial disparities are more apparent when looking at those who express a high level of confidence. Whites are more likely to say they are very confident they would know where to go for testing (46%) than are blacks (29%) and Hispanics (35%). Similarly, whites are more likely to say they are very confident they would be able to get tested (38%) compared to blacks (25%) and Hispanics (25%).

This report is part of ""Pandemic – A Nation Divided,"" ABC News' special coverage of the heightened racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Tune into ""Nightline"" for a three-day series this week, 12 a.m. ET on ABC.

Disparate views on testing confidence also emerge by party affiliation, especially when singling out Americans who said they are very confident about knowing where to go to get tested and having a test administered.

In the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, only 31% of Democrats and 36% of independents said they are very confident they knew where to get tested for the coronavirus if they needed to be, but 57% of Republicans said the same.

And when it comes to being tested, 29% of independents and 23% of Democrats said they are very confident that they could be tested if needed, compared to 52% of Republicans who said the same.

Trump has repeatedly touted the nation’s testing capabilities, saying the United States has the “best testing in the world” and is “doing more testing than anybody else.” But high profile Democrats have said the opposite, including the Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, whose home state of New York is one of the hardest-hit states throughout this pandemic.

During an interview on ABC’s ""The View"" Thursday, Schumer said testing ""has been one of the greatest failures of this administration” and that he hopes “they learn from it.""

The latest survey, capping two months of polling on the coronavirus, shows Trump’s underwater approval hitting a new low, as the country is as uneasy as ever about contracting the disease.

Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling the response to the coronavirus (COVID-19)? ABC News/Ipsos Poll

Only 39% of Americans approve of the president’s handling of the crisis - driven, largely, by waning support among independents - compared to 60% who disapprove. Just over one-third of independents (35%) approve of the president’s response to the coronavirus, a dip from one month ago, when 42% of independents approved.

In that same poll, released on April 17, 44% of Americans approved of Trump’s management of the pandemic, compared to 54% who disapproved. His newest marks are also a sharp decline from mid-March when his approval stood at 55%.

Trump’s approval is fiercely split by partisanship, with 7% of Democrats and 89% of Republicans approving of the president, while 92% of Democrats and 11% of Republicans disapprove.

Even as every state moves steadily towards reopening, Americans are not confident that the country is out of the woods when it comes to the deadly virus.

Over three in four Americans are concerned about contracting the coronavirus, while 22% remain not concerned.

Those concerns trace along both racial and party lines. Black Americans (87%) and Latinos (85%) are more concerned about getting the virus than whites (73%), with slightly more than half of blacks Americans (51%) and Latinos (52%) saying they are very concerned about the threat compared to 27% of whites.

How concerned are you that you or someone you know will be infected with the coronavirus? ABC News/Ipsos Poll

Democrats (94%) are far more likely than Republicans (59%) to be concerned about becoming infected, including 51% of Democrats and 20% of Republicans who say they are very concerned.

Still, only 6% of Democrats and less than half of Republicans (41%) say they are not concerned, including only 1% of Democrats and 11% of Republicans who are not concerned at all.

They are sharing memes, videos and recordings with misinformation, in which people tell you that in the hospitals they drain the fluid from your knees and planes spray the city with the virus at night.

‘Whoever gets it, will get it,’ says Roberto Zarazua, talking about Covid-19 at a brick factory in San Luis Potosí

At the same time, it is very hard for people to stop working and self-isolate as they are being asked to do. In the brick-making factories in the working-class areas on the periphery of the city, workers don’t have the money to protect themselves. There is no antibacterial gel, there are no face masks and there is no safe distancing. The prevailing attitude is: “The virus will strike who it strikes.”

Making preparations for Easter under lockdown in San Luis Potosí, where cases of Covid-19 are increasing

Those who do believe in the existence of the virus, and how lethal it is, have responded by attacking healthcare workers instead of staying at home and protecting themselves.

This is what happened to Sandra Alemán Arellano, a nurse who was attacked physically and verbally as she went to a convenience store wearing her uniform on the night of 3 April.

Sandra Alemán Arellano, who was attacked for being a nurse. ‘It’s not fair that this is happening to us.’

Within two weeks, San Luis Potosí went from being one of the states with the lowest rates of infection, with 74 confirmed cases and eight deaths, to one with the fastest growing number of cases in Mexico, with 364 confirmed and 19 deaths, as of 13 May. This may not seem high compared to other regions passing through the peak of the pandemic, but here there is a sense that things are spiralling out of control.

Life under lockdown in San Luis Potosí, where many people are ignoring physical distancing advice

San Luis Potosí has been mentioned in reports as being one of the few states not to abide by the order to stay at home. Compared with other big cities in Mexico, the state is two weeks behind in the transmission phase of Covid-19. It is thought that the state will reach the peak of the virus at the end of May and that the curve of infections will start to go down at the end of June.

The city is almost entirely reliant on industry. San Luis Potosí is a key link in the supply chains for companies such as General Motors and BMW. It has been part of the T-Mec free-trade agreement with the US and Canada since it originated in 1994 – because of its strategic connectivity between the Texas border and the centre of Mexico. Each car assembly line has brought hundreds of companies to the area.

As elsewhere in the world, because of the pandemic, most of the industries have closed.

The city is hoping to come out of lockdown and get the production lines started again

The automotive sector is Mexico’s main manufacturing industry. In 2018, it contributed 3.6% of national GDP and 20.7% of manufacturing income. The newly negotiated T-Mec comes into effect on 1 July.

The Mexican government’s recent announcement, after discussions with countries including the US, that production lines would reopen has brought optimism to the car industry – as well as to mining and construction. They have been declared essential industries and it is hoped that people will gradually return to work this week.

However, the continued rise in Covid-19 cases could have a negative impact on the health of millions of workers and their families.

These photographs are my way of understanding how the virus is changing our lives – how the light and shade of what we are facing in this pandemic define the identity of a city – and at the same of time making a record of the reality on a local level.

The global declaration of the pandemic occurred when I was in the Colombian Amazon at the start of March.

To get back home, I had to pass through four airports. As I travelled I felt totally alienated by the paranoia caused by the virus.

When I got back, I was confronted with the inability of the majority of people in San Luis Potosí to stop their activities and stay at home, the lack of information and the disbelief of the population. They were waiting for the virus to disappear."

Researchers analyzed more than 200 million tweets discussing coronavirus or COVID-19 since January. They found that nearly half were sent by accounts that behave more like a convincing bot than an actual human.

Of the top 50 influential retweeters, 82% were likely bots, the research showed. Out of the top 1,000 retweeters, 62% were likely bots.

More than 100 types of inaccurate COVID-19 stories were identified by researchers, including misinformation about potential cures and conspiracy theories — such as hospitals being filled with mannequins or the coronavirus being linked to 5G towers. Researchers said bots are also dominating conversations about ending stay-at-home orders and ""reopening America.""

The team said it was too early to point to specific entities that may be behind the bots “attempting to influence online conversation.”

""We do know that it looks like it's a propaganda machine, and it definitely matches the Russian and Chinese playbooks, but it would take a tremendous amount of resources to substantiate that,"" Kathleen Carley, a professor in the School for Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, said in a statement.

The team uses multiple methods to identify which accounts are real and which are likely bots. An artificial intelligence tool analyzes account information and looks at things such as the number of followers, frequency of tweeting and an account's mentions.

""Tweeting more frequently than is humanly possible or appearing to be in one country and then another a few hours later is indicative of a bot,"" Carley said.

""When we see a whole bunch of tweets at the same time or back to back, it's like they're timed. We also look for use of the same exact hashtag, or messaging that appears to be copied and pasted from one bot to the next,"" Carley added.

The team at Carnegie Mellon is continuing to monitor tweets and said posts from Facebook, Reddit and YouTube have been added to their research.

A Twitter blog post this week from Yoel Roth, the head of site integrity, and Nick Pickles, the global public policy strategy and development director, calls the word “bot” a “loaded and often misunderstood term.”

“People often refer to bots when describing everything from automated account activity to individuals who would prefer to be anonymous for personal or safety reasons, or avoid a photo because they’ve got strong privacy concerns,” the post states. “The term is used to mischaracterize accounts with numerical usernames that are auto-generated when your preference is taken, and more worryingly, as a tool by those in positions of political power to tarnish the views of people who may disagree with them or online public opinion that’s not favorable.”

Twitter told NPR it has gotten rid of thousands of tweets with misleading and potentially harmful information about the coronavirus.

In the blog post, Twitter adds that not all forms of bots are necessarily violations of Twitter — such as customer service conversational bots that automatically find information about orders or travel reservations.

The company said it is proactively focusing on “platform manipulation,” which includes the malicious use of automation aimed at undermining and disrupting the public conversation, such as trying to get something to trend.

For someone who is unsure about an account’s authenticity, Carnegie Mellon researchers said to closely examine it for red flags. If the account is sharing links with subtle typos, many tweets are being posted in rapid succession, or a user name and profile image doesn’t seem to match up — it may be a bot.

""Even if someone appears to be from your community, if you don't know them personally, take a closer look, and always go to authoritative or trusted sources for information,"" Carley said. ""Just be very vigilant.""
