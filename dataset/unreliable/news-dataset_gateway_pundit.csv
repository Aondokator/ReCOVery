The First Pentecostal Church of Holly Springs was suing government officials over the authoritarian lockdown after police ordered church members to disperse on Easter Sunday.

The church fought back after it received a citation for violating ‘social distancing’ orders for allowing up to 40 people to congregate for Bible study.

On Wednesday the church was destroyed in a fire.

Newsweek reported:

A church in Mississippi that burned down in what authorities say was an arson attack had previously defied the city’s stay-at-home order and was suing officials over lockdown measures. The First Pentecostal Church of Holly Springs on Highway 178 was destroyed in a fire in the early hours on Wednesday, WMC reported. According to the station, investigators found evidence that the fire was intentionally set, including graffiti in the church parking lot that said “Bet you stay home now you hypokrits (sic).”

Jerry Waldrop, who has been the church’s pastor, told the WMC that the church has “no enemies that we know of.”

Waldrop said: “We don’t know anyone that we even think could be capable of doing something like this.”

There is ongoing censorship, even in the scientific literature, to restrict publication of information contrary to the accepted narrative that COVID-19 is naturally-occurring.

What follows is not an analysis of motivations or an indictment meant to assign blame, but a history of scientific investigation that eventually led to COVID-19.

A recent news article published in the scientific journal Nature noted, that while it is important to find the origin of COVID-19 to prevent reinfection, it has been difficult pinpointing the source.

TRENDING: AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN: Alan Dershowitz Says Americans Can be Forced to Take Coronavirus Vaccine (VIDEO)

“It is quite possible we won’t find it. In fact, it would be exceptionally lucky if we land on something,” said Lucy van Dorp, a geneticist from University College London.

It may indeed be impossible to identify a natural source, if COVID-19 was the product of bio-engineering.

Although there are hundreds of scientific publications on coronavirus, a few relevant to the present discussion will be highlighted.

Coronavirus research did not begin with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS, SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1) epidemic of 2002-2004, but it was certainly accelerated by it.

Additional impetus for studying coronaviruses arose after the 2012 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS or MERS-CoV).

That has been the consensus scientific opinion both for SARS and MERS, that it may have originated in bats, traveled through an intermediate animal host, civets and camels, respectively, and, along the way, acquired the ability to infect humans.

If such a contention is scientifically valid, then it is initially logical to presume that COVID-19 “jumped” from animals to humans in a similar fashion.

SARS may have originated in a bat population, but it was not the direct source.

In a 2008 bioengineering study designed to elucidate the origin of SARS, scientists “spliced” the SARS RBD onto a non-human-infecting bat coronavirus, thereby, producing a new viral entity of bat origin capable of infecting humans.

According to the present conventional wisdom, a COVID-19 precursor, while circulating in a bat population mutated, acquiring the ability to infect humans, perhaps through an intermediate host, which was then transmitted to people either visiting or working in the Wuhan Seafood Market.

That conclusion is not as scientifically solid as some would like you to believe.

It was already known by the end of January 2020, that the initial patients hospitalized between December 1-10, 2019 had not visited the market and bats were not sold there.

The Nature article, “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,” widely cited to support the theory that COVID-19 is naturally-occurring also raises some not so widely cited doubts.

The fact that no natural source of COVID-19 has been identified, that scientific evidence exists suggesting bioengineering and the clear ability to do so, all demand an expanded investigation as to its origin.

[Note that we reported nearly a month ago that reports that the coronavirus occurred naturally are most likely propaganda coming from the Chinese regime in an organized disinformation campaign.

Yaacov Apelbaum at the Illustrated Primer shared with The Gateway Pundit information that supports the fact that the entire Wuhan bat soup story is fake news. Various claims that the virus started at a wet market in Wuhan are almost certainly false. Now we can add to this scientific support as well.]",20,Low,Right

The actions of New York’s governor Andrew Cuomo have led to thousands of coronavirus deaths in the state.

A memo dated March 25, 2020, ordered state officials to move coronavirus patients to nursing homes.

It was New York state policy to put the sick patients back in the nursing home.

This order has since been removed from the New York State Department of Health website.

More people died in nursing homes in New York, due to Governor Cuomo’s policies, than died on 9/11.

Michael Goodwin at the New York Post reported this week:

Two weeks ago, Gov. ­Andrew Cuomo was first asked about his policy that forced nursing homes to admit ­patients infected with the coronavirus. “That’s a good question, I don’t know,” the governor answered, turning to an aide. On Tuesday, Cuomo was asked about a report from the Associated Press that his team had added more than 1,700 deaths to the count of those who died in nursing homes, bringing the total to at least 4,813. “I don’t know the details, frankly,” the governor answered, turning to an aide. Sgt. Schultz reporting for duty! Cuomo is legendary for micromanaging and has been praised for his detailed daily briefings during the pandemic. He has closed schools, religious services and businesses because each human life is “priceless.” So with known nursing home deaths representing 25 percent of all deaths in the state, it beggars belief that the governor didn’t know anything about his office’s fatal policy two weeks ago or the new death totals now. The only way either could be true is through an extreme case of plausible deniability. Thus, if there’s no proof he knew, he can’t be held responsible, right? Which was the whole point of the Sgt. Schultz defense. That was a sitcom. This is life and death.

According to NBC News, New York’s policies for nursing homes required the homes to take in individuals that had the coronavirus:

The coronavirus patients began arriving the last week of March, transferred to the Gurwin Jewish Nursing and Rehabilitation Center under a New York state mandate requiring nursing homes to accept those recovering from COVID-19, even if they still might be contagious.

The governor’s nursing home policy in New York ended up in thousands of deaths.

Nearly 3,000 names appear on the 9/11 Memorial. This is the list of individuals who were innocently murdered on 9/11 when terrorists took down New York’s World Trade Center’s Twin Towers.

Governor Cuomo created a list of more innocents murdered due to a policy requiring New York nursing homes to accept those with the China coronavirus than those murdered on 9/11. What kind of individual could even think up such a policy?",20,Low,Right

This is not because of social distancing – it’s because the coronavirus is not yet as deadly as the seasonal flu!

A comparison of data available as of today, shows that the China coronavirus is not as deadly as the Spanish flu of 1918. As a matter of fact, it’s not as deadly as the seasonal flu.

In 1918 the world suffered from the Spanish flu. The flu devastated the Western world as was reported by History.com:

The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide—about one-third of the planet’s population—and killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million victims, including some 675,000 Americans. The 1918 flu was first observed in Europe, the United States and parts of Asia before swiftly spreading around the world. At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat this killer flu strain. Citizens were ordered to wear masks, schools, theaters and businesses were shuttered and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly global march.

One in three people in the world were infected with the Spanish flu and between 20 to 50 million died. In the US 675,000 people died from the Spanish flu, out of a population of around 104,550,000.

The seasonal flu worldwide is no Spanish flu but millions do reportedly suffer from the flu annually. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the flu kills an estimated 650,000 people annually worldwide. The CDC estimates that in the 2020 flu season, around 43,000 Americans died from the flu.

The China coronavirus, which the world reacted to with total shut downs and panic, is not as serious as the Spanish flu and isn’t even as deadly as the flu this year worldwide. To date nearly 330,000 people have died from COVID-19 worldwide. This is horrible but how does it compare to the Spanish flu or the flu?

The China coronavirus has less than 1% of the deaths that occurred worldwide during the Spanish flu.

Put another way, if the same percent of individuals died from the China coronavirus as died from the Spanish flu, there would be over 181 million deaths from the coronavirus.

Also, note that to date, the China coronavirus is not even as deadly as the seasonal flu to date worldwide. It’s about half of the seasonal flu.

It really is past time to open up the economy.

It never should have been shut down in the first place.",20,Low,Right

Hong Kong shut down industry and commerce since the Chinese New Year on January 25th in reaction to the China coronavirus.

The country is into its fourth month of commercial inactivity even though its 8 million citizens endured only 4 COVID-19 deaths total to date.

As reported in late February:

TRENDING: AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN: Alan Dershowitz Says Americans Can be Forced to Take Coronavirus Vaccine (VIDEO)

News of the coronavirus reached Hong Kong and the world in early January. Hong Kong citizens were curious at first and then almost hyper-reactive. The Wuhan coronavirus was a big unknown and still is. Hong Kong did very little at first other than observe the actions of the Chinese government in Hubei in response to the newly discovered coronavirus. By the end of January right before the Chinese New Year, the government of China took the unprecedented move and shut everything down in Hubei Province in China. Road blocks were erected and people were forced to stay home in Hubei Province. After the Monday and Tuesday holidays, all businesses were shut down in Hong Kong and throughout China.

Schools were closed at that time and are still closed in spite of children worldwide being virtually immune to the coronavirus. Most companies follow the Hong Kong government’s practices with civil servants and keep their employees home. This has continued since late January.

Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated areas on earth with a population of around 8 million people.

As of this morning there are 1056 coronavirus cases confirmed and four deaths in Hong Kong.



The percent of confirmed cases to total population is minuscule at 0.01%.



The mortality rate related to the coronavirus in Hong Kong is almost nothing but this didn’t stop the government from shutting down its economy.



Dr. Mark Siegel on FOX News shared the success that Hong Kong has had with its practices of shutting down the economy with only 4 COVID-19 deaths. Unfortunately, someone told him that Hong Kong only used social distancing to maintain its low death rate for COVID. This is false. The government of Hong Kong shut down its economy and it may never recover.

Via Tucker Carlson:”>Tucker Carlson Tonight:

Dr. Siegel, who appears to be a very honest and committed professional, praised the efforts of Hong Kong to prevent China coronavirus deaths. But maybe he doesn’t have the full picture. Since the beginning of the year the flu in Hong Kong has been much more consequential than the coronavirus:

The Centre for Health Protection announced today [February 13] that the winter flu season has ended. During this period, 113 adults died of influenza and no deaths from children were recorded. The Centre reminds the public that although the winter flu peak period has ended, citizens should continue to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent respiratory diseases.

In the mean time entire industries in Hong Kong are in shambles.

Thousands of airline pilots are out of work. These individuals with good paying salaries are leaving Hong Kong. Restaurants and small businesses are closed and will likely never reopen. But sure, Hong Kong has only 4 COVID-19 deaths!

So maybe the real issue that most in the media are still not acknowledging is that the China coronavirus is typical to a seasonal flu except that infants, children and young adults are not as likely to die from it. The efforts to lock down communities went way overboard. Unfortunately it is too late to save economies like Hong Kong.

Sure China should be held accountable for its manufacturing and spreading of the China coronavirus. But anyone who promoted that mass hysteria to shut down over the coronavirus has a price to pay too. This unfortunately includes well-meaning medical professionals who lacked the facts or the courage to speak out against the mass destruction of the world economies.

The entire country of Hong Kong has shut itself down now into its fourth month due to four deaths reported from the coronavirus. Now the Hong Kong economy is dead too with numerous small businesses shut down for good.

This will go down as the single most insane event in world history.",20,Low,Right
